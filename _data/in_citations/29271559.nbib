AB  - Drug discovery and development is commonly schematized as a "pipeline," and, 
      although appreciated by drug developers to be a useful oversimplification, this 
      cartology may perpetuate inaccurate notions of straightforwardness and is of 
      minimal utility for process engineering to improve efficiency. To create a more 
      granular schema, a group of drug developers, researchers, patient advocates, and 
      regulators developed a crowdsourced atlas of the steps involved in translating 
      basic discoveries into health interventions, annotated with the steps that are 
      particularly prone to difficulty or failure. This Drug Discovery, Development, 
      and Deployment Map (4DM), provides a network view of the process, which will be 
      useful for communication and education to those new to the field, orientation and 
      navigation of individual projects, and prioritization of technology development 
      and re-engineering endeavors to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The 4DM is 
      freely available for utilization, modification, and further development by 
      stakeholders across the translational ecosystem.
