In this context, the project aims to develop non-NGS approaches to detect and quantify the toxins involved (LC MS / MS, MALDI-ToF and ELISA), propose methods to differentiate pathogenic strains from non-pathogenic strains, and perform a series of inter-laboratory tests to evaluate and optimize the performance of the methods developed. The CIP operates at different levels of the project, S. aureus and B. cereus in particular, with Dominique Clermont as responsible for a work package.Antibiotic resistance: emergence and gene transferThe emergence of antibiotic resistance creates a new challenge for public health, and there is no simple solution. CIP is hosting a unique collection of clinical isolates to study history and evolution of resistance in ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Acinetobacter baumanii,Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and many others.Resistance to antibiotics can be either intrinsic to a given bacterial species or acquired by genetic mutations and foreign DNA pieces not present in the natural populations. Species identification and means to identify genes coding for resistance to antibiotics are integrated in our pipelines of genome data analysis from CIP deposited strains. We are developing sophisticated methods to implement such a resistance gene prediction workflow in order to detect what is not already known, searching all possible acquired resistance genes and novel resistance signatures.Genome sequencing of type strainsThe CIP, because of the great biodiversity of its collection, was requested by the WDCM (WFCC-MIRCEN World Data Center for Microorganisms) (http://www.wdcm.org/) to participate in a large-scale genome sequencing project of type strains over five years.Valorization of the biotechnological potential of CIP strains200 strains of bacteria belonging to the groupBacillus cereussensu lato were studied in terms of belonging to this or that species of the group, their content of toxins or virulence factors. The analysis of the genomes also made it possible to detect clusters of interest. The characterization of unknown molecules with potential antimicrobial activity is ongoing."

Systematic studies aim to better understand the evolutionary history of life and lead to essential knowledge to establish accurate taxonomy (species description, naming, and relatedness).The main goal of our group is to address issues that are associated to biological classifications by inferring and analyzing phylogenetic trees that represent the evolutionary history of genes or species (e.g.Guglielmini et al. 2019). Moreover, our group also provides expertise and analyses on related fields: sequence homology detection and orthology assessment, bacterial genotyping for epidemiological surveillance,de novoandab initiogenome assembling for phylogenomics studies, reference database creation (e.g.RVDB-prot;Bigot et al. 2020) and bioinformatics tool implementation (e.g.JolyTree;Criscuolo 2019,2020) for dealing with large-scale sequence datasets.For more details (information, datasets, programs, tools), see our alternative webpage:giphy.pasteur.frHave also a look at ourFAQ"

These features allow Cyanobacteria to colonize the Earth, notably their oxygenic photosynthetic capacity that contribute largely to the balance between CO2 and O2 in the atmosphere. Adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, they colonize most ecosystems. In continental and marine water bodies, the abundance of bloom-forming representatives disrupts the equilibrium of these environments and the potentially associated cyanotoxins may be harmful to animals and Man.Since July 2009, the Collection of Cyanobacteria maintains the collection Pasteur Cultures of Cyanobacteria  (PCC:access to PCC webpage), and dispatch the pure PCC strains to the research community worldwide. This ressource is also used for our own research activities, focused onthe evolutionandthe natural products of Cyanobacteria."

They constitute a small animal model in which to analyzepotency and safety of new drugs modulating the immune system.HIS-mice are immunodeficient recipient mice that have been transplanted with a human immune system, or some of its components. Our basic model uses aBRGS (Balb/c-Rag2-/-IL2R γ-/-SIRPαNOD)highly immunodeficient recipient lacking T,B (Rag2-/-) and NK (IL2Rγ-/-) cells as well as macrophage tolerance due to the human-compatible SIRPα gene.  This immunodeficient mouse strain is well reconstituted with human immune cells from human hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells. This model develops all majorhuman lymphocyte classes (B, T and NK cells)and their specialized subsets as well as a variety ofmyeloid cells (dendritic cell, monocytes, and macrophages).More recently, new models have been derived from BRGS mice to improve differentiation and activity of some human immune cell sub-populations– BRGS-A2DR2 (expressing HLA-A2 and DR2 transgenes) HIS micewith improved human T-cell development and function after injection of matched HSCs.– BRGSF (BRGS Flk2-/-) HIS micewith improved human myeloid and NK lineage after boost with soluble Flt3L.– BRGST (expressing mTSLP transgene) HIS micewith improved lymph node development.Within the HDM core facility, we produce humanized mice from these differents immuno-deficient mouse models.If you are interested by working with us or If you want more informations, please contacthdm@pasteur.fr"

                "content": "Chemogenomic and biological screening are important steps in the discovery of new medicines as well as in precision medicine but also in dissecting molecular pathways and biological networks.What we do:Target-based (High Throughput Screening, HTS) and phenotypic (High Content Screening, HCS) screening assays are powerful tools to identify active chemical substances and genetic modulators of function (siRNA, miRNA, gRNA) providing starting points for drug design or for understanding biological processes. Using liquid handling devices, sensitive detectors and data processing software, HTS/HCS allow a researcher to rapidly test a large number of samples.Typical screening cascade:Our expertise:• We assist research teams with the development of robust bioassays compatible withHTS/HCS standard from the assay optimization to the miniaturization and automation.We also provide guidance for the design of orthogonal (secondary selectivity) assays.• We conduct the screening campaigns of libraries of interest, upload and analyze the data, using our carefully annotated database (Collaborative Drug Discovery), cherry-pick hits for re-testing in dose response experiment (EC50 determination) in order to provide you with a high-quality hit list.• We provide strong support for hit to lead and lead optimization processes (medicinalchemistry, ADME/Tox studies, MOA studies, aggregation/solubility test), especiallyfor some promising projects with high therapeutic index.Technologies we support:• Biophysical techniques using absorbance, fluorescence, luminescence such as timeresolved fluorescence resonance  energy transfer (TR-FRET), AlphaScreen, fluorescence polarization allow for the miniaturization of assays which measure enzyme, receptors, protein:protein/DNA/RNA interactions. Biolayer interferometry technology enables for high-throughput label-free detection using the Octet HTX instrument (ForteBio, Molecular Devices).• Automated microscopy and reporter gene assays allow for measurement of phenotypic changes and signal transduction processes. For HCS, phenotypic analysis in single cell (2D) or organoids (3D) can be carried out with a conventional automated microscope (IX83, Olympus) or the high-resolution microscope StellarVision (Optical Biosystems) that uses structured illumination and Synthetic Aperture Optics (SAO).• With our liquid acoustic dispenser (Echo550, Labcyte), we can easily reformate multiwell plates (96, 384, 1536 wells), offer cherry picking service and prepare any daughter plates from various biological and chemical collections.How to work with us:A request for support starts by sending an email topfccb@pasteur.fr. You will be asked to give us an overview of your project at first and then meet in person to give us any details so we can figure out together the best way to develop your HTS or HCS bioassay. We can assist you to become autonomous on some automated equipment, help you during every steps of the screening process and can perform for you a medium and large screening campaign.Libraries :Commercial focused libraries :FDA approved and phase I passed (3,372 cpds, Selleckchem, L3800)Target selective library (601 cpds, Selleckchem, L3500)Anti-cancer library (921 cpds, Selleckchem, L3000 + 2923 cpds, TargetMol)Lipid metabolism library (297 cpds, TargetMol, L2510)LOPAC (Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds) (1280 cpds, Sigma, LO4100)Ubiquitination compound library (198 cpds, Selleckchem, L6000)Antibacterial library (10880 cpds, Life Chemicals)Screen-Well FDA approved drug (774 cpds, Enzo Life Sciences, BML-2843)Antifungal library (253 cpds, TargetMol, L4500)Nucleoside analogue library (135 cpds, Selleckchem, L7200)Protein Kinase targeted inhibitor library (9360 cpds, ChemDiv)Nucleobases analogs (NECAN) (4620 cpds, ChemDiv)Commercial non-focused libraries :Natural Compound library (480, cpds, GreenPharma, GPNCL)Diversity library (10,000 cpds, Enamine)Fragment library (1015 cpds, Selleckchem, L1600)Access to : Chimiothèque nationale (71744 cpds) + chimiothèque essentielle (CNE) (1040 cpds)In house libraries :FrPPIchem library (10314 cpds, O.

The metabolomic team will support researchers from the definition of experimental design to the interpretation of the results. They benefit from state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational methods. It includes the latest generation of high speed, high-resolution mass spectrometers as well as bioinformatics and statistical tools to analyze the complex high-dimensional data generated.Our activitiesLarge-scale metabolomic and lipidomic analyses can provide with important information about many cellular processes and their disturbances:comparison of metabolomes between several biological systems allows genotypes and phenotypes to be linked.comparison of metabolomes within the same group of biological systems under different conditions enables to elucidate the influence of the environment on the expressed phenotype.One of the main challenges of these analyses is to be able to measure metabolites with extremely diverse physico-chemical properties whilst we have not an exhaustive knowledge of all existing metabolites yet. One of the specificities of the platform is to elucidate on a large scale these unknown compounds for a fine understanding of cellular physiological mechanisms.The main goal of the platform is to help researchers by conducting metabolomic experiments and analyses. Our activity can be divided into 3 main project types:Help researchers answer their biological questions: projects submitted by Pasteur or external teamsInternal developments: MCF-specific projects to acquire new approaches in metabolomics and to anticipate the future needs of the Institut PasteurTransversal technological research with other internal or external teams (platforms, research units)We are also eager to give advice and help researchers elaborate their metabolomic projects.Do not hesitate to contact us atmetabolomics@pasteur.frif you have any question.How to work with usMetabolomic analyses can be long processes, and their objectives must be well defined prior to any work at the bench. The experimental design is particularly critical to make sure the results obtained are robust enough and unbiased with regards to your biological question.

The laboratory is  part of the C2RT (Center or Technological Research and Ressources) and of the Structural Biology and Chemistry department. It is IBISA labeled since 2012 and ISO 9001:2015 certified since April 2018.Theplatform, headed by M. Matondo, provides service and collaboration in bottom-up proteomics. It is open to external users.The research group develops four main axes:Top-down proteomicsis an emerging technology based on the analysis of intact proteins using very high-resolution mass spectrometry. It provides the highest molecular precision for analyzing primary structures and determining post-translational modifications by examining proteins in their intact state, leading to more straightforward and reliable results than the classical bottom-up approach based on protein enzymatic digestion. Top-down proteomics holds great promise in clinical research and in particular in clinical microbiology, a major research axis of the unit.Cross-linkingcombined to mass spectrometry is a powerful approach to address both the structure and composition of protein complexes. To improve the crucial stage of detection and characterization of cross-linked peptides, we have developed a new generation of cross-linking agents based on click-chemistry.Native MSallows the structural investigation of protein complexes with the sensitivity, speed, unlimited mass range and accuracy of mass spectrometry. The exact mass of the proteins can be obtained, as well as the stoichiometry of the assembly, its conformation and topological arrangement of the subunits within the complex.HDX (Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange) MSis based on the different exchange rates of hydrogens in proteins. Exchange rates are a function of solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding. HDX MS can be used to monitor conformational changes in proteins, characterize protein folding pathways or protein-protein interactions. HDX MS is also widely used for epitope mapping.For more information on these different topics, please contactJulia Chamot-Rooke"

NMR (equipment and expertise) can be used for fragment or drug-screening and drug-design, to characterise intrinsically disordered proteins or polysaccharides, to follow post-translational modifications in cell extracts, to monitor reactions in real-time or to determine the chemical structure of natural or synthetic molecules (Figure 1).For more information on the NMR activity, you can contact us at:bionmr@pasteur.frThe Hydrogen/Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) activity at Institut PasteurHydrogen/Deuterium eXchange followed by Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a powerful and recognized biophysical tool in structural biology capable of probing protein/ligand interactions, conformational changes, and protein folding and dynamics (Figure 2). HDX-MS measures the changes in mass imposed by the replacement of backbone amide hydrogens by deuterium added in excess in the surrounding environment. The rate of exchange relies on the folding and dynamics of proteins making backbone amide hydrogens excellent structural probes (more details about the principle of hydrogen exchange can be foundhere).We  are currently using an optimized version of theHDX-MS systemcommercialized by the Waters Company composed of a Synapt G2-Si HDMS mass spectrometer with ETD and IMS capabilities, a LEAP-Pal robot for automated sample handling, a cooled HDX manager that maintains the valves, columns and associated tubings at 0°C and Class M nanoACQUITY UPLC pumps (Fundings: CACSICE Equipex, C2RT Institut Pasteur). Our pipeline has been completed with the development of a software named “MEMHDX” to aid in the rapid statistical validation and visualization of large HDX-MS datasets. A schematic overview of a  classical HDX-MS experiment performed with our optimized HDX-MS  workflow is presented inFigure 3.The majority of our HDX-MS projects focus on soluble, membrane-associated or integral membrane proteins that are either involved in infectious disease or considered as potential drug targets. Most of these projects are carried out in collaboration with internal or external collaborators.Our  expertise in HDX-MS include:Analysis of the conformation and dynamic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and large proteins (> 150 kDa).Analysis of small molecule/protein interactions.Analysis of protein/protein interaction (e.g.,activation of theCyaA toxin) and identification of binding sites (e.g.Epitope mappingfor both the academic and pharmaceutical sector).Analysis of protein/DNA interactions.Analysis of the conformation and dynamic of integral membrane proteins (e.g.,the human glutamate transporterEAAT1).Optimization and improvement of the HDX-MS pipeline (e.g.MEMHDX; details about the principle of the software can be foundhere).For more information on the HDX-MS activity, you can contact us at:bionmr@pasteur.frClick hereto obtain the C2RT bookletClick here to obtain the mapof the C2RT technological core facilities"

The platform has obtained significant funding from the Institut Pasteur and from external sources such as the National Genopole Network (RNG-France), and from GIS-IBISA allowing us to upgrade or to acquire new equipment. Our crystallogenesis pipeline today is the most fully automated amongst academic institutions in France. Each year more than 900 different protein samples are submitted to automated crystallization assays. Most of these samples (about 80%) originated from crystallographic research groups within the Structural Biology & Chemistry department and the Virology department at the Institut Pasteur. The remaining 20% originated from out of campus entities (Institut de biologie physico-chimique, CEA-Saclay, and Universités Paris 7, Paris 6, etc…).Our second mission is to offer expertise in bio-crystallography, from crystallogenesis to resolution of 3D crystal structures. We ensure this mission by participating as a partner in scientific research projects (ANR, PTR, and individual collaborations) involving structural studies of single proteins and protein complexes. These projects arise from direct collaboration with research groups at the Institut Pasteur and outside research organisations.Automated system for crystallization service:–    The Tecan workstation Gemini 150 for liquid handling.–    The MOSQUITO robot can be used for the sitting or hanging drops (varying from 100 to 1000nl).–    The MATRIXMAKER robot can automatically design  the desired crystallization screens on different supports (50 ml tube, 15 ml tube, 96 deep-well block or 24 wells VDX plate).X-ray diffraction service:–    A RIGAKU micromax 007 X-ray generator with standard rotating anode (wavelength 1.54 Å, copper).–    A system of multi-layer X-ray optics from OSMIC.–    A mar345dtb image plate X-ray detector from MARESEARCH.–    A Cryo-system from OXFORD INSTRUMENTS to collect diffraction data at liquid nitrogen temperature.With this system, users can answer several questions:–    Are my crystals proteins or salts?–    What is the unit cell or the space group of my crystal?–    What is the best cryo-solution to freeze my crystal?It is also possible to collect complete data-sets for native proteins crystals.=> See the “services” section for more information.To find out more about the Technology Department, seehere."

                "content": "SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION (expect changes)In the last 5 years, interest in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has grown exponentially due to groundbreaking new developments in instrumentation. This has resulted in the 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry being awarded to three pioneers from the field of cryo-EM. Institut Pasteur has invested significantly in this technology with the purchase of 4 high-end systems and the erection of the Nano-Imaging Core Facility.Transmission Electron Microscopes are known for being able to achieve atomic resolution in material science applications (MS). This is possible due to the well defined nature of the specimens that are in many cases crystalline (i.e. silicon wavers) or adopt other latices structures (i.e. metals). In addition the elements under scrutiny often fall in the category of heavy elements with large nuclei that provide additional forms of contrast in an electron microscope. On top of this, these samples can withstand a high dose of electrons before being destroyed by the intensity of the beam, which provides a high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the recorded images. As a result, MS samples can often achieve very high sub-Ångström resolution in the images that allow clear images of individual atoms.Two sub-Ångström resolution images showing single atomsIn life science (LS) we use electron microscopes to study cells, organelles, macro-molecular machinery and proteins inside or isolated outside the environment of the cell. Proteins are almost never crystalline in nature, nor are they well order or well defined. They are very long polymeric molecules folded into flexible (at the atomic level) structures consisting of predominantly light elements (C, O, N, H). The atomic bonds in these molecules can be easily broken by the high energy electrons which will deform the protein structure rapidly. As a consequence, images need to be recorded using a significantly lower dose, resulting in noisy images that have additionally low contrast due to the light elements and the absence of lattice order. Only by developing and using special dedicated low noise cameras and new image processing algorithms in the last few years, has it been possible to extract high resolution information on a relative routine basis.The core facility will focus on 4 main applications in cryo-EM: Sample Screening, Single Particle Analysis (SPA), cryo-Electron Tomography (CET) and cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM)Single Particle Analysis (SPA)Cryo-FIB and Tomographyhttps://research.pasteur.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/research_pasteur-nanoimaging-cryofib.mp4"

                "content": "We provide comprehensive HPC resources and services for Institut Pasteur researchers. Our missions are:Install and operate HPC clustersProvide computing resources including cutting edge computing facilities (GPUs for example):manage servers and systemsInstall new servers and handle maintenance operationsensure resources availability and performanceensure compliance with security policiesUser supportclusters access and on-boardingjobs monitoringrequests trackingresource usage optimisationdocumentation and proceduresSoftware management and developmentinstall and maintain relevant software collections on all HPC clusters operated by the CFinstall and maintain reference data catalogue (ex: Genomes data banks)workflow/code acceleration profiling and optimisationprofessional software development for the specific needs of some units.GovernanceThe High Performance Computing Core Facility has dual affilation : IT Dept and DTPS. The core facility Steering Committee (SC) helps define, support and follow-up the strategic vision for the core facility (CF):supports recruitment needslarge equipment purchase decisionspositioning of the facility in the national/international contextproject arbitrationinternal/external communication strategy.Operation modesThe HPC2F operates in in open access mode. Every Institut Pasteur researcher is entitled to access HPC clusters. Resource allocation is based on a fair share principle: the more a given user uses resources the less it has priority for upcoming allocations. For strategic purposes a certain amount of dedicated resources can be allocated on a case-by-case basis. Access to HPC clusters is conditioned on a mandatory training session ensuring basic skills to use the systems. User support is provided via request tracking system.All Requests will be categorised and normally a followup is provided in 2 days The HPC2F is keeping users informed about maintenance and updates via a low-frequency mailing list, to which users are automatically subscribed.FundingInstitut Pasteur internal funding provides common computing resources shared by all users (see Operation modes). It is also used to introduce new and experimental computing technologies. Sizing of common resources is  established by the HPC2F under guidance of  SC and UC (see Governance) Research teams needing dedicated resources are required to fund them out of their own budget. They can be selected from a catalogue (provided by the HPC2F), which is regularly updated. HPC2F assumes the cost of integration and operation, including networking and electricity costs. While the owner has highest priority on their hardware, it can be used by other researchers temporarily. Some requests and services of the CF will generate additional fees:acquisition of the commercial softwarelarge reference data installation (e.g. Gene databanks)software development/optimisation (subject to special arrangements)TrainingNew users are obliged to go through an e-Learning training session, where they learn to connect to the service, submit jobs and other necessary skills. Tailored training sessions can also be set up for advanced features:efficient use of available resourcesspecial hardware (GPU, bigmem etc)checkpointingintra- and inter-node parallelisation (OpenMP, MPI)These on-demand training sessions can be organised with at least 6 weeks prior notice, with hands-on sessions on real user-provided projects. The HPC2F team can also contribute to other training sessions organised by other Institut Pasteur groups. We are part of theC2RT(Center for Technological Resources and Research), a center gathering the Technology and Service units (UTechS) and the technological core facilities of the campus. As such we follow thecommon guidelines and good practices.Aknowlegements / CitationWe’d like to ask research teams using core facility resources and services to acknowlege this through a citation in there publications :“We acknowledge the help of the HPC Core Facility of the Institut Pasteur for this work.”"

                "content": "The Image Analysis Hub is an open access, equal accesscore facilitycommitted to offeringbioimage analysis services to the scientific community.What we do.The IAH works mainly by collaborating scientifically with its users, trying to achieve a significant added-value to their Research.Our services are deployed in four activities:Infrastructure for autonomous image analysis.We maintain and offer access to workstations dedicated to and tailored for image analysis software. This includes academic open-source software such as Fiji, Icy, ilastik, QuPath, … and commercial software likeImaris,HuygensandArivis. They are under maintenance contract and regularly updated.The workstations are located in a common analysis room in the François Jacob building (aquarium, room 26-01-17) and can be booked viaour PPMS instance. We also offer access to virtual machines, that can be connected to remotely, on and off campus.Walk-in support and trainings for questions involving image analysis.Our users can consult us for bioimage analysis questions related to their project. We can also contribute to experimental design, with our colleagues from the imaging core facilities when required. We offer one-one training sessions on image analysis software, to address a specific question in a project. Finally, we teach general bioimage analysis techniques at introductory and advanced levels during yearly events such as bioimage analysis courses (likethis one) and workshops or thePhD program.Walk-in support happens mainly via ouropen-desk sessions. Every two weeks, on Thursday morning from 9:30am to 12:30am, the whole IAH and colleagues are gathered in the aquarium of the François Jacob building (room 26-01-17). We welcome users on a first-come first-served basis, and try to address their question immediately. Several analysts can work with one user, and we often invite research engineers from the campus to participate.The open-desks sessions are the single entry point for all our services.If you want to request a collaborative project, a training or discuss what we could do to support your project, the one place to do so is the IAH open-desks. All the open-desk sessions for this year are listedon this page.Build and deploy custom analysis tools for projects requiring special developments.Our central activity consists in developinghighly customized analysis pipelinesor scientific tools tailored to address specifically a user project. This activity is important when a user project requires analysis that is not provided by the existing image analysis tools, or when they require modifications or integration in larger pipelines. The delivery of these services can take two forms:Quantification projects.A user would delegate an analysis task to us, a sub-part of their research project. Our goal then is produce scientific results from their images, up to the production of a figure for a publication, with the redaction of the associated Materials and Methods section.Custom development of analysistools.We strive not to limit ourselves to be users of bioimage analysis software, but to be able to modify them and build new tools, tailored for the user project. Once built and validated, we deliver them to the user’s lab and teach their uses limitations.Develop  software platforms for image analysis.We are the developers of several image analysis platforms. For instance:TrackMateMaMuTMastodonLocalZProjectorandDeProjclEsperantoGeNePy3DMVRegFusand we are involved in the core development of several software packages for bioimage analysis:IcyFijiThe scope of these software tools goes beyond a single user-project. They are developed and elaborated when used on multiple user projects and during dedicated engineer time. They are made to be extensible and modular, and are used later to quickly develop bespoke analysis pipeline for future user projects.Obtained labels.The IAH operates within a Quality Management System following the ISO-9001:2015 norm, and we achieved certification by the AFNOR in 2019, within the C2RT ISO-9001 certification. Following the ISO9001 certification, the IAH obtained the IBISA label in October 2019."
