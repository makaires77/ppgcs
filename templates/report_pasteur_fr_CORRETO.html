Many emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, in which an animal pathogen has crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans.AIDS, Ebola, SARS, avian flu, chikungunya, Zika, the past fifty years have witnessed an alarming increase in the emergence of new infectious agents into human populations.  Known parasites, bacterial and fungal pathogens are re-emerging due to ecosystem modifications, leading to the development of synergistic epidemics. Most of these emerging infectious diseases are related to pathogens from the animal world which crossed the species barrier and adapted to humans.  In other instances, gene reassortment or mutations in the microbial genome lead to novel agents able to spread among humans. Vectors, such as the mosquitoesAedes, are now firmly established in tropical and temperate zones to facilitate the dissemination of the so-called arboviruses. The Institut Pasteur, with more than one hundred research units, 14 national reference centers, 6 WHO collaborating centers and connections with an international network of 32 institutes worldwide, is uniquely positioned to respond to these threats.DEDICATED TEAMSSix thematic areas (Total of 88 entities including research units, G5, WHO and national reference centres, collections and platforms).<br><br><b>Propósito da área:</b><br>To analyze the biological and epidemiological determinants of infectious disease emergence into human populationsTo develop new tools for pathogen identification and characterization in the context of epidemics or diseases of unknown originTo study the factors associated with individual susceptibility to infections, including the role of genes, immunity, and the microbiotaTo understand host-microbe interactions, and identify novel targets for diagnosis, vaccination and treatmentTo study the biology of vectors and vector-pathogen interactions, for the development of environmentally friendly and safe control strategies<br><br><b>Objetivos da área:</b><br>Increase internal and external visibility of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) research at Institut Pasteur via communication activitiesReinforce Institut Pasteur research on EID through creation of new G5s and targeted fundingCreate a community at the Parisian campus and Pasteur Network levels for generating, sharing, and analyzing sequencing data from emerging or re-emerging pathogensRespond to the current COVID-19 pandemic (taskforce Corona, Pasteur Network mobilization, participation to the scientific committee advising the government)Prepare the future epidemics at the Institute (epidemics preparedness unit) and national (PIA4-AAP, PERP Prezode) levelsSet up an infrastructure for the identification and development of human monoclonal antibodies for research and therapeutic purposesBuild a state-of-the-art insectarium for vector researchDevise a genomic taxonomy of microbial strains.<br><br><center>================================================================================</center><br><br>Área: <b>ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE</b><br><center>Director: Paola Arimondo (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>Director: Philippe Glaser (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Emilie Boutet (Project Manager)</center><br><center>: Fabrice Agou (Head of Facility)</center><br><center>: Anna-Bella Failloux (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Thierry Fontaine (Permanent Researcher)</center><br><center>: Didier Mazel (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Didier Ménard (Visiting Scientist)</center><br><center>: Lulla Opatowski (Group Leader)</center><br><center>: Félix A.

There is an urgent need for actions to reverse the curve of antimicrobial resistance dissemination and to develop innovative drugs (antibiotics, antiparasitic, antifungals, antivirals, antivectors) and therapeutic strategies for safer and sustainable treatments of infectious diseases. To respond to this urgency, theInstitut Pasteurstrategic plan fosterscutting edge projectsto tackleantimicrobial resistanceby incorporating clinical and field data within molecular, chemical, genetic and physiological approaches.The global rise in antimicrobial resistance means that we are at risk of heading towards a post-antibiotic era, where common infections once again become life threatening. This dire prediction has raised awareness at the highest levels, including the United Nations and the G20. Therapy escape and the need for more effective treatments are not restricted to bacteria; they concern all microorganisms (viruses, fungi and parasites) and their vectors. Challenges include the emergence of resistance of the malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparumto artemisinin, the most effective treatment, and mosquitoes’ ability to change their behavior to counter insecticides.Institut Pasteur research efforts to tackle Antimicrobial Resistance concern 6 main approaches :Institut Pasteur AMR scientific community includes 74 research Laboratories (G5 / U5 / U10), 29 research Groups, 10 National Reference Centers, 9 Platforms/UTechS, and a number of microbial collections.<br><br><b>Propósito da área:</b><br>To improve understanding of resistance emergence and dissemination by combining approachesinvolving epidemiology, genomics, statistics, evolutionary biology, structural biology, chemical biology and modeling to identify factors contributing to the spread of resistant strains and resistance genes.To analyze the physiology, ecology and evolution of microorganisms and their vectors. The molecular mechanisms governing microbial growth, metabolism and acquisition of resistance will be studied. For example, structural and chemical biology allow to characterize the mode of action of resistance at the molecular level. The complex interactions between the host and communities of microorganisms need to be taken into account to understand resistance. We aim at analyzing the formation of complex structures (e.g. biofilms) and the processes of quiescence, dormancy, persistence and tolerance, which represent additional means of treatment escape.To identify new drugs and therapeutic strategies in response to antimicrobial resistance. We are synthetizing focused chemical libraries and exploring new targets, as those involved in host-microbe interaction and in the life cycle of the infectious agents. Phenotypic and molecular screening are implemented to identify selective inhibitors, phage therapy is further explored and diverse environments are exploited to find new natural products. In parallel, we aim at novel vaccines and immunotherapies to target microbes and resistant strains.<br><br><b>Medidas da área:</b><br>Recruit two five-year research groups (G5s)/research units.Propose research funding that encourages novel synergistic and interdisciplinary approaches for the development of new treatments and alternative strategies to tackle infections.Adopt metabolomics analysis techniques to examine microbes and their hosts.Build a collaborative network of clinicians and public health experts.Involve research units in the International Network in research on resistance.Foster public-private partnerships for diagnostics and antimicrobial drug development.<br><br><center>================================================================================</center><br><br>Área: <b>BRAIN CONNECTIVITY AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES</b><br><center>Director: Chiara Zurzolo (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>Director: Uwe Maskos (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Laure Bally-Cuif (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Thomas Bourgeron (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Gérard Eberl (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Florent Haiss (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Pierre-Marie Lledo (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Uwe Maskos (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Nicolas Michalski (Permanent Researcher)</center><br><center>: Chiara Zurzolo (Head of Structure)</center><br><br><b>Descrição da área:</b><br>The brain is a complex organ, and its well-being depends on the harmonic interactions with the rest of our body. Nearly all brain disorders manifest themselves in the dysfunction of communication between brain cells (neurons) as well as communication with other organs (gut, immune system, etc), which we define asBrain Connectivity Disorders. This super-family of neurological disorders includesneurodegenerative,neurodevelopmental,psychiatric, sensory-motor, immuneandinfection-relatedbrain diseases.Mental and neurological disorders represent a significant health burden in high-income countries. Combined they account for nearly 25% of lost workdays, a health burden that surpasses both that of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Specifically, neurodevelopmental disorders can last throughout the individual’s lifetime (e.g. the health burden for Autism is 1.4 billion Euros each year).Higher life expectancy has also increased the prevalence of age-related disorders, and in particular Neurodegenerative disorders. Dementia affects 36M of people worldwide, of which 25M are affected by Alzheimer disease. It represents a cost of more than 480 billion euros/year. In 2030 this figure will raise to more than 80M. These numbers are not sustainable. The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative disorders requires the search for novel mechanisms (molecular, cellular, physiological and pathogen-associated) that will allow the development of effective therapies.At the Institut Pasteur, we seek to leverage our diverse fundamental research strengths in the fields of neuroscience, genetics, cell and developmental biology, molecular and structural biology, immunology, microbiology and infection biology and the state-of-the-art technological advance to tackle complexity of brain function and connectivity diseases. Only by this multidisciplinary approach we will be able to understand brain diseases and develop innovative therapies.We have Identified the following research thematics:<br><br><center>================================================================================</center><br><br>Área: <b>CANCER INITIATIVE</b><br><center>Director: Ludovic Deriano (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>Director: Sandrine Etienne-Manneville (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Ludovic Deriano (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Sandrine Etienne-Manneville (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Jean-Pierre Vartanian (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Han Li (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Marc Delarue (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Ivo Gomperts Boneca (Head of Structure)</center><br><center>: Pascal Pineau (Permanent Researcher)</center><br><br><b>Descrição da área:</b><br>With more than 19.3 million new cases in 2020 worldwide, including nearly 400,000 in France, cancer is a common disease that affects or will affect us all one day, directly or indirectly. It is nevertheless a serious disease. It is one of the main causes of death on an international scale and killed more than 10 million people in 2020. It has been the leading cause of death in France since 2004 and is responsible for more than one in four deaths. In fact, despite the progress made in cancer treatment over the last 30 years, the disease is still claiming as many victims, with the number of new cases diagnosed each year constantly increasing. Current treatments are, moreover, particularly long and expensive and have a heavy impact on the economy of countries. More than 1,000 billion dollars are spent each year on treatment and support for patients. France spends 2 billion euros annually on anti-cancer molecules and 6 billion on hospital costs. Most patients are not completely cured and the risk of recurrence remains high. It is therefore crucial to optimize existing therapies and to develop innovative strategies that accelerate and improve patient management and cure them once and for all. To achieve this, it is essential to identify the causes of resistance to existing treatments, to develop innovative therapeutic strategies based on an in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms of tumor development and also to prevent the disease by determining the risk factors.The work of the Institut Pasteur is based on three main axes :<br><br><center>================================================================================</center><br><br>Área: <b>VACCINOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY INITIATIVE</b><br><center>Director: James Di Santo (Head of Structure)</center><br><br><b>Descrição da área:</b><br>Vaccines have had a major positive impact on public health world-wide through disease prevention that can be measured in millions of lives saved. Despite the successes, we still facemajor challenges in vaccine and immunotherapy developmentfor global, neglected, or newly emerging diseases and in ourunderstanding of the determinants of vaccine protection. To address these issues, the Institut Pasteur is harnessing its collective expertise that includes immunologists, microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists, vaccine and immunotherapy specialists, in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur International Network, Institut Pasteur Medical Center, and external partners to launch theVaccinology and Immunotherapy Initiative.TheVaccinology and Immunotherapy Initiative addressestwo major areas in vaccinology and immunotherapy that require immediate attention:New vaccine candidates and/or immunotherapies are needed to combat global diseases for which current approaches so far have failed, for neglected diseases, for new emerging infectious diseases, and for diseases with increased risk for antimicrobial resistance.How many currently used vaccines provide protection against disease remains poorly understood. The immunological mechanisms that operate in different individuals vary and a better understanding can help to design more effective vaccines and to identify potential non-responders that should receive additional medical attention.Institut Pasteur has a distinguished history of vaccine development as a means to improve global health. Currently,five vaccine candidates are under clinical evaluation, either licensed to commercialization partners or under Institut Pasteur sponsorship. Building on this expertise and by integrating fundamental, translational, and innovative science, theVaccinology and Immunotherapy Initiativepursues the following aims:These aims and measures are embedded in ongoing world-wide vaccine and immunotherapy efforts and carried out in collaboration with leading institutes and initiatives, including theVaccine Research Institute(VRI),European Vaccine Initiative(EVI),BioAster, Clinical Investigation Center (CIC)Cochin-Pasteur, theCoalition for Epidemic Preparedness(CEPI),Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(BMGF),Wellcome Trust,European Commission, and industrial partners.<br><br><b>Propósito da área:</b><br>To identify novel approaches, targets, and technologies for vaccines and vaccination as well as for immunotherapies.To accelerate vaccine and immunotherapy candidates from research to clinical trials and to engage development partnersTo gain a better understanding of underlying mechanisms in vaccinology and immunotherapyTo enhance the knowledge, capacity, and public awareness in vaccinology and immunotherapy<br><br><b>Medidas da área:</b><br>Create a“One-stop-shop”to nucleate activities for vaccinology and immunotherapy, to foster interdisciplinary collaboration integrating basic science, translational research and innovation, to guide match-making for projects requiring specific services or expertise, and to support building new and sustainable partnerships with industry, co-development organizations, and academic institutions.Promotefundamental researchwith potential for high impact on vaccinology and immunotherapy through ‘seed’ projects funded via institutional grants. Provide support for coordination of external calls with academic, clinical and industrial partners in key target areas.Launch theInstitut Pasteur Innovation Accelerator. The Institut Pasteur Innovation Accelerator develops and guides the development strategies for potential products, provides industrial scientific guidance for application-targeted research, spearheads the search for funding, and coordinates activities with the aim to advance the projects to a readiness level that will facilitate technology transfer to commercial entities or co-development with large public funders. The Innovation Accelerator is co-piloted by the Scientific and Innovation directions and coordinates fundamental and translational activities in the four fields of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and technologies.Developclinical research in vaccinology and immunotherapyto pursue programs to decipher vaccine responsiveness in normal and immunosuppressed individuals by integrating different approaches and linking the Vaccination Center at the Institut Pasteur Medical Center, the Labex Milieu Intérieur (healthy cohort studies using complementary approaches), immunology monitoring, the
