                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research.

                                                The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) was founded in 1907 by a group of eleven physicians and scientists interested in research to further the investigation and spread the knowledge of cancer. Today, AACR accelerates progress toward the prevention and cure of cancer by promoting research, education, communication, and advocacy.
The AACR Cancer Disparities Research Fellowships represent an effort to encourage and support postdoctoral or clinical research fellows to conduct cancer disparities research and to establish a successful career path in this field. The proposed research may be in basic, translational, clinical, or population sciences research and must have direct applicability and relevance to cancer disparities.

                                                The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) was founded in 1907 by a group of eleven physicians and scientists interested in research to further the investigation and spread the knowledge of cancer. Today, AACR accelerates progress toward the prevention and cure of cancer by promoting research, education, communication, and advocacy.
The AACR Clinical Oncology Research (CORE) Training Fellowships Program is designed to provide an industry-academic clinical practicum with a unique opportunity for academic clinicians to train in drug development.
It is expected that the fellow will be accountable for executing clinical activities and research projects to be completed during the one-year program. Depending on the background of the fellow, additional focus areas may also be provided (e.g., preclinical research, biomarker discovery). Opportunities for publication and presentation of completed work will be provided. The industry partners for this program and their areas of interest include the following:
Johnson & Johnson (facility location to be agreed to, but possible locations include the greater Boston or Philadelphia areas):
Early-stage clinical development in interventional immuno-oncology therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Early-stage clinical development program aiming to intercept lung cancers in a high-risk population

The AACR-Lobular Breast Cancer Alliance-Deborah Mueller Foundation Fund Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Innovation and Discovery Grants is a new grant mechanism intended to stimulate and develop creative, paradigm-shifting ideas in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) to encourage translation into new treatment options that may not be funded through conventional channels. The grants are named for and in honor of Dr. Deborah Mueller, a devoted board member of the LBCA who died precipitously of metastatic ILC. Applications are invited from researchers currently in the field as well as investigators with experience in other areas of cancer or biomedical research.

                                                The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to harnessing the immune system's power to control and potentially cure all types of cancer. It funds the most innovative clinical and laboratory research around the world, support the next generation of the field's leaders, and serve as the trusted source of information on immunotherapy for cancer patients and their caregivers.
The Technology Impact Award provides seed funding to address the gap between technology development and clinical application of cancer immunotherapies. The grants aim to encourage collaboration between technology developers and clinical cancer immunologists and to generate the proof-of-principle of a novel platform technology in bioinformatics, ex vivo or in silico modeling systems, immunological or tumor profiling instrumentation, methods, reagents and assays, or other relevant technologies that can enable clinician scientists to generate deeper insights into the mechanisms of action of effective or ineffective cancer immunotherapies.

                                                The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical research and projects targeting one clinical indication or organ. It is meant to fund research that could lead the way to a new reimbursable clinical application for image-guided FUS within five to seven years.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research that, if successful, could have a profound impact on the field of focused ultrasound and that could change the way many conditions are treated.
Researchers in the U.S. and abroad. Brazilian citizens are eligible.

                                                The Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation was founded in October, 2006, as a small, tax-exempt organization. But it has a driving, entrepreneurial spirit, and this mission: to develop new applications for focused ultrasound, and accelerate its worldwide adoption.
The General Awards Program provides funding for investigator-initiated clinical, preclinical, and early-stage research projects that fall outside our Brain, Cancer Immunotherapy, and Veterinary Programs through a competitive peer-reviewed application process.
The program has two tracks:
The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical studies and research projects that target a particular clinical indication or organ.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research.

O impacto da imunoterapia no câncer da próstata avançado (CaP) tem sido limitado. Nossa hipótese é que a perda da fosfatase homóloga à tensina (PTEN) em CaP induz alterações transcricionais, que ativam a via PI3K-mTOR e tornam o microambiente tumoral (TME) evasivo ao sistema imunológico. A perda de PTEN, juntamente com outras mutações, resulta em alteração do padrão transcricional da célula tumoral, interfere com a ação das células imunológicas e a produção de citocinas, e limita a eficácia da imunoterapia.
São 2 vagas de pós-doutorado:
PD-1: Análise da Resposta do TME à Perda de PTEN
Utilizará abordagem de RNA-seq de células únicas e Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP). O candidato investigará o microambiente imunológico tumoral em CaP metastático e estará envolvido na coleta de amostras, realização do RNA-seq de células únicas e na análise de dados DSP.
PD-2: Estabelecimento de Organoides Derivados de Tumores de Pacientes com PCa Metastático
O projeto visa a utilização desse modelo para explorar a resistência a medicamentos e as interações entre as células cancerígenas e o TME. O candidato estará envolvido na coleta e processamento das amostras tumorais, estabelecimento das culturas 3D e realização dos estudos pré-clínicos, bem como co-cultura de organoides com células do sistema imune e organização do biobanco de amostras dos pacientes.

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
Work supported through this mechanism (Advancing Therapies) will address important mechanistic questions and developmental therapeutics across the care continuum and have the immediate potential to increase survivorship. Given the specific interest in the development of novel therapies that could benefit this group of patients in the relatively near-term, a clinical trial must either be initially incorporated into the project or be an immediate result of the outcome of the research. It is expected that a program of correlative, translational research will be proposed that will enhance the understanding of these oncogenic-driven lung cancers.
Working in conjunction with IASLC, we will encourage applications on a wide variety of topics related to oncogene-driven lung cancer.

the goal of the 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program is to fund innovative projects across the full spectrum of basic, translational, clinical, epidemiological, health services, early detection, disparities, and social determinants of health research. 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program include but is not limited to the following topics:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immune-therapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes • Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;
Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer.

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
This funding mechanism is focused on identifying, characterizing, and developing approaches and techniques that will allow early detection and/or prevention of lung cancer and gaining insight into preneoplastic processes in the lungs. The ultimate goal is to detect lung cancer at the earliest stages and subsequently increase survival and survivorship. While this list is not exclusive, general areas of interest include:
Identification and characterization of new biomarkers for NSCLC and SCLC
Liquid biopsy assays and related techniques
Improvements in risk stratifying patients for screening
Development of predictive, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers
Genomic and histological approaches to improve early detection in tissue samples
Novel imaging modalities to identify and risk stratify pre-neoplastic lesions
Studies of pre-neoplasia and progression to lung neoplasia that may inform prevention strategies
Development of pathways to increase uptake and utilization of lung cancer screening

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
In 2024, in partnership with leading patient advocacy organizations, this grant mechanism will focus on understanding the development, prevention, and therapy of resistance by supporting projects that are identifying, characterizing, treating or preventing resistance to therapies in lung tumor cells, tissues, mouse models, and/or patients. Work supported through this mechanism will address important mechanistic questions and developmental therapeutics across histological subtypes of lung cancer (including lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer) and across the care continuum including newly designed targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These studies will enhance the momentum of improving lung cancer outcomes and have the potential to increase survivorship. We encourage applications on a wide variety of topics related to understanding resistance including:
Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies for oncogene-driven lung cancers;
Biology and mechanisms of drug resistance to lung cancer therapies i.e. chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy;
Novel treatment approaches and new therapies to overcome and/or prevent resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Novel diagnostic approaches to monitor treatment response and relapse.

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
Minority Career Development Award (CDA) in Lung Cancer is considered a prerequisite for establishing independence, academic promotion, recognition as an expert, serving on grant review panels, and leadership roles. Minority applicants are less likely to receive grants, to have the R phases of K01 or K99 awards activated, need more submissions to obtain funding, and often will not resubmit proposals. As minority applicants must overcome systemic and structural barriers due to race, ethnicity, country of origin, socioeconomic status, and/or language, many leave academia which further exacerbates the lack of diversity in STEM and medical fields.
Applications on a wide variety of topics including but not limited to the following:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immunetherapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes;
Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;
Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate research in discovery and development of novel, small molecules for cancer. Molecules discovered through this NOFO may be used to probe cancer biology, to validate cancer targets, or as the basis for optimized drugs.
Stages of discovery research covered by this NOFO include: 1) development of the primary screen assay(s) and testing in an initial pilot screen; 2) primary screen implementation to identify initial screening hits (high throughput target-focused screens, or moderate throughput screens); 3) hit validation using a series of assays and initial medicinal chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit set.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages applications that investigate the biology and underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a significant health problem both in the United States and globally. Because of the high incidence and frequent tumor recurrence, bladder cancer exacts an outsized medical burden. While recent progress has been made in the molecular profiling of bladder cancers and identification of mutated genes, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms driving initiation, progression and malignancy of bladder cancer. Furthermore, our understanding of the biological processes of the normal bladder at the molecular, cell and organ levels is limited. Fundamental knowledge of how molecular and cellular functions of the bladder are altered in cancer will aid our understanding of bladder cancer biology and contribute to the future development of new interventions.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to facilitate well planned clinical trials across the cancer prevention and control spectrum aimed at improving prevention/ interception, cancer-related health behaviors, screening, early detection, healthcare delivery, management of treatment-related symptoms, supportive care, and the long-term outcomes of cancer survivors. Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns this can include a pilot/feasibility clinical trial if necessary, improving trial design and rigor.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) (R01/R21)is to enhance mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations addressing the roles of co-infection and cancer to shed light on presently unestablished pathways in carcinogenesis that may inform prevention and treatment strategies for infection-related cancers. Co-infection is defined as the occurrence of infections by two or more infectious (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) agents – either concurrently or sequentially – and includes both acute and chronic infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and/or other microorganisms. Preference will be given to investigations of co-infections with known oncogenic agents (excluding human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and of co-infections that engender novel opportunities for prevention and treatment.

The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to invite exploratory/developmental research grant applications (R21) for innovative informatics methods and algorithms to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, or interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects with a significant level of data generation and/or data analysis will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to promote epidemiologic research investigating novel and innovative hypotheses on emerging risk factors (biological, environmental, and social) and their interplay with established risk factors (e.g., viral hepatitis) associated with the development of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma and other histological subtypes) in the United States.
Areas of research interest include, but are not limited to the following:
The role of non-viral risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, NASH, metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, and other environmental factors) and liver cancer (HCC and non-HCC) risk;
The role of metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and influence of other risk factors in the progression of fatty liver, NASH, and cirrhosis to the development of liver cancer;
The interactions of multiple risk factors (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, metabolic syndrome, smoking, host genomics and immunologic responses) in the etiology of liver cancer;
The role of social, behavioral, and host factor determinants in explain differences in incidence and mortality rates for liver cancer across multiple populations;
Examination of novel hypotheses, risk factors, and biomarkers of liver carcinogenesis (e.g., cellular factors, telomere maintenance and length, metabolites, microbiome signatures, epigenomic alternations, gene expression and protein expression);
The role of pharmacologic factors (e.g. statin and metformin) and non-pharmacological supplements in liver cancer using population-based studies;
The role of blood circulating factors, possible biomarkers, and liver cancer development and progression; 
Investigation of factors that contribute to the differential risks of liver cancer between men and women.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this funding opportunity announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of exploratory/developmental research grant (R21) applications that focus on different aspects of cancer control by modifying behavior, screening, and understanding etiologic factors contributing to the development of cancer, and developing ways to control cancer. The overarching goal is to provide support to promote the early and conceptual stages of research efforts on novel scientific ideas that have the potential to substantially advance population-based cancer research, such as the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of cancer research (e.g. epidemiologic, biomedical, behavioral, health care delivery or clinical).
Specific topics in each of these research areas represent examples of research that DCCPS supports and could be supported through this FOA:
Epidemiology and genomics research;
Behavioral research;
Health care delivery research;
Surveillance research.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support the development of state-of-the-art projects that integrate imaging, biomarkers, digital pathomics, glycomics, metabolomics, other omic information and/or meta data obtained from platforms including but not limited to lower resolution diagnostic acquisitions and systemic biomarker results to high resolution single-cell analytics / imaging applied to the characterization of heterogeneous cell populations within tumor for improving current approaches for: (1) the early detection of organ confined premetastatic aggressive cancer, and, (2) identifying precancerous lesions associated with the development of a subsequent lethal phenotype. This FOA specifically attempts to address and improve diagnostic uncertainty in clinical decisions by improving detection sensitivity and specificity of integrated multiparametric platforms. For example, N-dimensional co-registered, cross-correlated imaging data integrated with multiplexed biomarker results and/or digital pathomics, glycomics, or metabolomic imaging using analytic strategies such as artificial intelligence or virtual reality visualization techniques. The projects supported by this FOA will collectively participate in the existing Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB) Research Program. The goals of the CIB are to: (1) improve diagnostic performance by developing methodology for the early identification of potentially lethal cancer versus non-lethal disease, (2) minimize/better manage overdiagnosis and (3) reduce false positives and false negatives.
This FOA will utilize the NIH Research Project Grant (R01) mechanism and is suitable for projects where proof-of-principle of the individual proposed methodologies have already been established and supportive preliminary data are available.

Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends  to support the rigorous assessment of barriers to quality cancer treatment and follow-up care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) cancer survivors. This funding opportunity is intended to address a critical need for improved care delivery and outcomes for SGM cancer survivors. The goal is to address the disease burden in an underserved and understudied population that is at higher risk of poorer health outcomes. The NCI solicits proposals for observational and/or interventional studies of SGM survivors designed to understand barriers and/or improve care and outcomes for SGM people with cancer, using interoperable sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection in cancer care settings, where appropriate.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits grant applications proposing exploratory research projects focused on the early-stage development of highly innovative technologies offering novel molecular or cellular analysis capabilities for basic, clinical, or epidemiological cancer research. The emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel capabilities involving a high degree of technical innovation for targeting, probing, or assessing molecular and cellular features of cancer biology. Well-suited applications must offer the potential to accelerate and/or enhance research in the areas of cancer biology, early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, control, epidemiology, and/or address issues associated with cancer health disparities. Technologies proposed for development may be intended to have widespread applicability but must be focused on improving molecular and/or cellular characterizations of cancer biology. Projects proposing the application of existing technologies where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical target/question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support extramural research to investigate and mitigate challenges facing clinical assay development and subsequent analytical validation due to preanalytical variability in tumor tissue biopsies, blood biospecimens utilized as “liquid biopsies", or other biospecimens as described in this FOA. Extramural research funded under this FOA may include investigations of preanalytical variability associated with the procurement and study of small biopsies (core biopsies, small excision samples), blood utilized for "liquid biopsies", tissue swabs, tissue secretions, pleural and esophageal aspirates, feces, or bodily fluids like sweat, urine, CSF, breast milk and saliva. Investigator-designed experiments will explore how different biospecimen preanalytical conditions affect emerging and clinically relevant biomarkers quantified by a variety of testing platforms. The results from this research program will improve the understanding of how analytical quantification of clinically relevant biomarkers is affected by variation in biospecimen collection, processing, and storage procedures. The overall goal is to expedite biomarker clinical assay development through evidence-based standardization of biopsy handling practices.
Sponsored studies to date include:
Studies demonstrating that preservation methods can impact gene expression of a subset of transcripts differentially;
Studies on the effects of blood biospecimen collection tubes, processing times, time in freezer, and freeze/thaw cycling on protein integrity;
The effects of tube type, time on bench and storage temperature on circulating miRNA detection;
An assessment of the effect of cold ischemia on protein detection in breast cancer tissues;
The effects of cold and warm ischemia on the detection of gene expression and protein phosphorylation in post resection tissues;
Studies to evaluate the effects of cold ischemic time, specimen preservation, and storage methods on RNA yield, RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values, transcript integrity and microarray-based measurements of gene signatures.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for investigator-initiated studies addressing mechanisms by which incretin mimetics, specifically glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 or dual GLP-1/ glucose dependent insulinotropic polypepide (GIP)-1 receptor agonists (RAs), impact cancer risk.  The focus on these agents is due to their reported effects on thyroid, prostate and other cancer risks, and the generally more favorable efficacy and side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics. In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the cancer biology field who may study incretin mimetic effects on diseases other than cancer. Investigators wishing to study incretin mimetics other than GLP-1 RAs or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, must justify why the agent(s) they propose to study are more effective and/or have a more favorable side effect profile than GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs. Route of agent administration (oral vs. other) is, by itself, not an adequate justification.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) aims to support research on interdisciplinary population approaches to increasing awareness of the relationship between alcohol and cancer risk, understanding and changing social norms related to alcohol consumption, developing and/or evaluating alcohol policy approaches, and the development, testing, and implementation of population-level interventions to reduce alcohol-related cancer risk. Applications that address multiple levels of consumption, such as moderate and heavy drinking, are of particular interest, as well as those focusing on alcohol use disorder (AUD) from the perspective of cancer prevention and control. Proposals addressing understudied areas are encouraged, as is attention to underrepresented minority (URM) populations experiencing cancer and alcohol-related disparities such as American Indian, Alaskan Native, and sexual and gender minority populations.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages grant applications to support research in established cancer epidemiology cohort studies, defined as studies that have achieved their initial planned recruitment goal. Applications must include hypothesis-based research using data from an established cohort study and are expected to include support for cohort maintenance, continued follow-up, and sharing of the existing resources in addition to addressing research questions across the cancer control continuum.

Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for projects to expand, improve, or transform the utility of mammalian cancer and tumor models for translational research.
The NCI, through this NOFO encourages submission of projects devoted to demonstrating that mammalian models, including organoids, tumoroids and cell models, used for translational research are robust representations of human biology, are appropriate to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for patient benefit. These practical goals contrast with the goals of many mechanistic, NCI-supported R01 projects that use mammals, or develop and use mammalian cancer models, transplantation tumor models, or models derived from mammalian or human tissues or cells for hypothesis-testing, non-clinical research.
Among many other possible endeavors, applicants in response to this NOFO could propose demonstrations of how to overcome translational deficiencies of mammalian oncology models, define new uses of mammalian models or their genetics for unexplored translational challenges, advance standard practices for use of translational models, test approaches to validate and credential models, or challenge current practices for how models are used translationally.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to develop a pediatric research data resource populated by genome sequence and phenotypic data that will be of high value for the communities of investigators who study the genetics of childhood cancers and/or structural birth defects.
Kids First has established and continues to develop a Data Resource including a collection of curated genomic and phenotypic data from childhood cancer and structural birth defects cohorts and a central portal where these data and analysis tools are accessible to the research community. Access to these data will promote comprehensive and cross-cutting research and collaboration leading to more refined diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies. This FOA is intended to support meritorious small research projects focused on analyses of childhood cancer and/or structural birth defects genomic datasets generated by the Kids First program and/or associated phenotypic datasets. Development of approaches, tools, or algorithms appropriate for analyzing genomic, phenotypic, and/or clinical data relevant to Kids First may also be proposed.

                                                Os Institutos Nacionais de Saúde (NIH) , parte do Departamento de Saúde e Serviços Humanos dos EUA, são a principal agência federal para conduzir e apoiar pesquisas médicas. Composto por  27 Institutos e Centros , o NIH oferece liderança e apoio financeiro a pesquisadores em todos os estados e em todo o mundo.
A Rede de Pesquisa de Metástase (MetNet) do Instituto Nacional do Câncer (NCI) é uma coleção de Centros de Pesquisa U54 que apoiam o uso de abordagens em nível de sistema para entender questões urgentes em metástase. O objetivo geral da MetNet é avançar nossa compreensão da metástase como um problema de corpo inteiro, em nível de sistema, para desenvolver uma imagem abrangente e coesa dos processos envolvidos. Através deste Anúncio de Oportunidade de Financiamento (FOA) , o NCI convida inscrições para Projetos de Pesquisa MetNet.Estes Projetos de Investigação devem ser definidos como entidades distintas que abordam o nível de sistemas para abordar lacunas e oportunidades na investigação de metástases para integração na MetNet e complementar a investigação em curso em toda a Rede.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute intends to support basic and translational research that will guide the development of a prophylactic or therapeutic Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) vaccine. A prophylactic KSHV vaccine could prevent primary KSHV infection, transmission, and subsequent development of KS and other KSHV-associated syndromes such as multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), or ameliorate the severity of disease. A therapeutic KSHV vaccine could be helpful in preventing or treating KSHV disease in people already infected with KSHV. The U01 research projects funded through this NOFO will form a cooperative group, the KSHV Vaccine Development Consortium (KVDC).

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs about future outcomes, including one’s response to cancer or cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social, psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members, caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from populations historically underrepresented or excluded from biomedical and behavioral research.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of applications that propose to advance research in cancer etiology and early detection biomarkers, utilizing the advantages of the unique biorepository resources of the NCI-sponsored Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. The PLCO Biorepository offers high-quality, prospectively collected, serial pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm participants, and a onetime collection of buccal cells from both the screened and the control arm participants. Available data associated with the biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking, screening results, and other clinical data. This FOA supports a wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to, biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported under this FOA.
Specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
Identifying biomarkers of various environmental, biochemical, and genetic risk factors of cancer;
Pivotal validation of early detection blood biomarkers in pre-diagnostic samples;
Developing early detection and/or risk prediction models based on longitudinal patterns of the biomarkers;
Identifying blood biomarkers that correlate with clinical behavior of the tumors, especially those that differentiate between aggressive and indolent cancers;
Correlating blood biomarkers to tissue biomarkers, histological and molecular subtypes, and clinical behaviors;
Biomarker discovery in pre-diagnostic samples using high through-put, proven technologies; and
Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis).

Through this funding opportunity announcement, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) solicits applications to “Cancer Epidemiology Cohorts: Building the Next Generation of Research Cohorts” PAR. This funding opportunity announcement seeks to support initiating and building the next generation of population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts to address specific knowledge gaps in cancer etiology and survivorship. Specifically, it will support methodological work necessary to initiate and build cancer epidemiology cohorts that can address critical scientific gaps concerning (i) new or unique exposures in relation to cancer risks and outcomes and (ii) achievement of diverse populations in cohorts with the inclusion of understudied populations (e.g., racial/ethnic groups, rural populations, individuals living in persistent poverty areas, and others) with substantial community engagement.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support studies that will identify, develop, and/or test strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, practices, programs, tools, treatments, guidelines, and policies. Studies that promote equitable dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions among underrepresented communities are encouraged. Conversely, there is a benefit in understanding circumstances that create a need to stop or reduce (“de-implement”) the use of practices that are ineffective, unproven, low-value, or harmful. In addition, studies to advance dissemination and implementation research methods and measures are encouraged. Applications that focus on re-implementation of evidence-based health services (e.g. cancer screening) that may have dropped off amidst the ongoing COVID pandemic are encouraged.
All applications must be within the scope of the mission of one of the Institutes/Centers listed above.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits grant applications proposing to utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, or other non-oncolytic viruses and their natural products to study the underlying mechanisms of the complex interactions between microorganisms, tumors, and the immune system, and to explore their clinical potential for cancer imaging, therapeutics or diagnostics. Projects can focus on using microorganisms as anti-tumor agents, as activators of anti-tumor immunity, or as delivery vehicles for treatment, diagnosis, or imaging, complementing or synergizing with existing tools and approaches. This FOA will support basic mechanistic and preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models. Applicants are encouraged to address both the microbial and tumor aspects of microbial tumor interactions relevant to microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), tumor imaging, tumor detection, or diagnosis.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support basic research that elucidates mechanisms by which the human microbiome inhibits or enhances anti-tumor immune responses, and to identify potential novel molecular targets for cancer prevention strategies.
Applications should be focused on delineating how host interactions with specific microbes (or consortia) or their metabolites target immune responses that enhance or prevent inflammation-associated or sporadic tumor formation. Concentration, timing, and duration of administered beneficial microbes may alter its effectiveness and thus those parameters should be rigorously addressed in the application.
Appropriate topics for this FOA include but are not limited to projects that:
Determine how Lactobacilli species inhibit colon cancer and if its anti-tumor activity requires the induction of T-cell-dependent IgAs;
Examine how commensal microbiota affect differentiation of naïve T cells to distinct Th17 subsets that may suppress or enhance tumor formation;
Evaluate the role of colonic Foxp3+RORγt+ Treg cells in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of commensal microbes to prevent colon cancer;
Determine how modulation of commensal H2S production affects host immunosurveillance;
Examine how SCFA production may affect anti-tumor immune functions of tumor associated macrophage;
Examine how microbial bile acid metabolism affects immune responses in liver and colon tumors.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) supports preclinical and early phase clinical research, as well as correlative studies, directly related to advancements in cancer treatment, diagnosis, prevention, comparative oncology, symptom management, or reduction of cancer disparities. This includes (but is not limited to) development and testing of the following: new molecular agents or biologics for cancer treatment; management strategies for cancer-related symptoms or treatment-related toxicity; cancer screening or diagnostic tools, such as imaging techniques; cancer preventive agents or approaches; predictive and prognostic biomarkers for patient selection or stratification; clinically relevant in vivo or in vitro tumor models (including genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenograft models, organoids, and cell lines); and strategies to address therapeutic outcome disparities among underserved populations. In addition to novel agents, new treatment strategies may involve repurposed agents or novel combinations of interventions (including radiation), based on established mechanisms of action. Comparative correlative studies in cancer patients with age, gender, racial/ethnic, or health disparities are encouraged to explore mechanisms underlying their differential responses (efficacy and toxicity) and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Comparative oncology studies in dogs investigating strategies for treatment and diagnosis of human disease are supported as well.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites U01 cooperative agreement applications for Physical Science-Oncology Projects (PS-OP). The goal of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network (PS-ON) is to foster the convergence of physical sciences approaches and perspectives with cancer research to advance our understanding of cancer biology and oncology by forming transdisciplinary teams of physical scientists and cancer biologists/physician scientists. Examples of physical scientists may include engineers, physicists, mathematicians, chemists, and computer scientists. The PS-OPs, individually and as a collaborative Network along with other PS-OPs and the Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OC), will support transdisciplinary research that: (1) establishes a physical sciences perspective within the cancer research community; (2) facilitates team science and field convergence at the intersection of physical sciences and cancer research; and (3) collectively tests physical sciences-based experimental and theoretical concepts of cancer and promotes innovative solutions to address outstanding questions in cancer research.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs about future outcomes, including one’s response to cancer or cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social, psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members, caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from populations historically underrepresented or excluded from biomedical and behavioral research.

                                                Both new and established investigators are encouraged to apply. As we don’t have a young investigator award, we encourage the next generation of exceptionally creative thinkers to submit their ideas with potential to produce breakthroughs.
All established investigators requesting pilot funds should show how their study is a departure from ongoing funded work.
New studies may be an extension of other work but cannot overlap any funded study unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that new funding will not duplicate existing support.
Rising Tide will require the return of all issued funds if found to be duplication of other funding sources. The intent of your proposed study should be to provide preliminary data for future support from other funding sources, thereby driving new and better treatment options to market.

                                                The amount of each award will be based on the objectives of each grant and the availability of funds. The duration of the award is up to five years or less as specified in the grant award letter. Rising Tide will disburse awarded funds only if the recipient maintains strict compliance with reporting and participant accrual requirements as outlined in Rising Tide’s Research Funding Terms and Conditions.

                                                Rising Tide Foundation is a charitable, non-profit organization that promotes freedom to improve quality of life everywhere.
Rising Tide Clinical Cancer Research ’s funding program is to improve treatment options and quality of life for cancer patients by funding clinical studies focused on prevention, detection, treatments and survivorship. We are seeking to accelerate and support innovative and creative studies that have the high probability to change the paradigm for how cancer is treated today. The Rising Tide grant application is the vehicle by which proactive investigators may focus directly on their cancer patients’ clinical problems and treatments that may prove successful and have a high chance to be quickly implemented in daily practice. We are particularly interested in identifying and funding clinical investigators who: 
Have outstanding anti-cancer and supportive treatment ideas relevant to today’s cancer patients with a direct, meaningful therapeutic impact for enrolled patients. 
Are driven to deliver new and better treatment, symptom management, prevention and early detection options for their patients today through clinical trial studies directly relevant to Rising Tide’s Mission. 
Have collaborated to design novel, new, or pilot projects distinctly removed from currently funded research projects. 
Are in line with our patient centric approach and have a defined Patient Engagement plan throughout the the study. Priority will be given to research where patient engagement has happened very early at the research design and is clearly demonstrated in the application.

                                                Proposals from young investigators, established principal investigators and clinicians, scientists from other disciplines, and individuals with innovative new ideas for A-T research are encouraged, from academia as well as industry.
Scientists from the US and around the globe are welcome to apply for the funding.
Junior investigators are particularly encouraged to apply for grants, as we are eager to bring new people into the A-T research field who may commit their career and labs to this disease long into the future. We welcome fresh insights.

                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research.

                                                Founded in 1998 by co-chairmen Leonard A. and Ronald S. Lauder, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) aims to rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.
The Drug Development RFP supports investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies (or the international equivalent) and early-phase clinical trials that test promising pharmacological interventions and devices for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Both disease-modifying and symptomatic agents will be considered.
This funding opportunity prioritizes diverse drug mechanisms and modes of action related to the biology of aging and other emerging therapeutic areas for dementia. For this reason, amyloid targeted approaches and cholinesterase inhibitor proposals will not be considered for this RFP.

The aim of this RFP is to further develop and validate established biomarkers for which there is a clear clinical need in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This RFP prioritizes biomarkers with a defined context of use, a clear advantage over other relevant biomarkers, and a path to commercialization and/or clinical use.
Specifically, this RFP focuses on:
Developing novel PET ligands for clinical trials;
Supporting novel CSF biomarkers;
Validating innovative MRI approaches in larger cohorts;
Developing novel measures of functional activity such as EEG.

                                                Founded in 1998 by co-chairmen Leonard A. and Ronald S. Lauder, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) aims to rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.
The ADDF seeks to support studies of cognitive symptoms due to health conditions, comparative effectiveness research, and epidemiological studies that probe whether the use or choice of drugs alters the risk for dementia or cognitive decline.
The Prevention RFP supports:
Studies of Cognitive Decline and Risk Reduction
Comparative Effectiveness Research
Studies Leveraging the Consortium of Cohorts for Alzheimer's Prevention Action (CAPA)

                                                Potential applicants for AFSA funding should meet the following requirements and budget constraints:
The Principal Investigator (PI) must be fluent in English and, ideally, published in peer-reviewed English language medical journals. If applicant resides outside the United States, please indicate the budget in U.S. dollars.
The PI must be a board certified "M.D.", "D.O.", or "D.D.S." or a Ph.D. with applicable basic science research experience. If the applicant has not previously published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, AFSA strongly recommends that the applicant team up with a co-PI with research experience.
An application may be submitted with an institutional review board (IRB) pending, but the IRB must be approved before the project can be funded.
All funded projects must be capable of testing your hypothesis without reliance upon another funding source. AFSA is open to funding tag-ons to NIH-funded projects, but the AFSA portion must be clearly defined with a study hypothesis.
The methodology used to determine the required sample size for the proposed study must be provided.
No institutional overhead or other indirect costs will be paid and should not be included as part of any grant request. A letter to your institution explaining this condition can be requested if needed.
Beware that substantiative equipment costs or salaries for the PI and co-PI may jeopardize project funding. AFSA awards are intended for the collection of preliminary data needed to assist investigators with obtaining much larger sums of money from the NIH or other financial institutions.
AFSA does not fund studies related to behavioral, psychosocial, self-help, or movement therapies. If you are assessing a medication that is commonly prescribed for patients, then your project should provide new insights about the drug’s mechanism of action.

                                                AFSA was formed as a 501(c)3 charity in 1994, at a time when the NIH was spending less than a penny a patient on fibromyalgia research. While the U.S. government’s track record on fibro has improved, AFSA remains the only nonprofit dedicated to funding fibromyalgia research.
Testing therapies that may greatly benefit people with fibromyalgia is a top priority for AFSA. In fact, we funded the ground-breaking treatment trial of low-dose naltrexone, which was shown to be more effective for fibromyalgia than any of the FDA-approved drugs for the condition. However, the long-term goal of better treatments will strongly rely upon an improved understanding of what is occurring on a biochemical basis.

With AFSA’s financial assistance, we are hopeful that the following questions can be answered about fibromyalgia:
What are the mechanisms involved in producing the body-wide pain?
Why do patients wake up from a night’s sleep feeling stiff, achy, and tired? What is happening in the brain at night to make sleep so unrefreshing?
How is the extreme fatigue and brain fog (jumbled thoughts and memory impairments) related to the abnormal physiology of fibromyalgia?
To what degree does treatment of muscular knots lead to reduced overall pain and improved function?
What is the most effective therapy for targeting the muscle pain in fibromyalgia patients?
Are there medications used for other conditions that should be evaluated for treating people with fibromyalgia?
Can laboratory tests be used to accurately identify or diagnose patients?
Also, can this information be used to determine disease severity or aid in predicting more successful treatments for individual patients?

                                                The Amphibian Survival Alliance (ASA) is the world’s largest collaborative effort dedicated to amphibian conservation, research and education. From habitat protection to disease research, policy guidance to education program development, the Alliance builds real solutions by bringing together governments, industry, non-profits, citizens and others to address the leading threats to amphibians.
The Amphibian Survival Alliance recognizes the urgent need for immediate action in critical situations that threaten the survival of amphibian species or populations. Our Emergency Grants are designed to provide rapid financial support for on-the-ground conservation efforts that directly address these imminent threats, especially those that could lead to extinction within a short timeframe. We prioritize projects that can provide strong evidence of the urgency and are designed for quick implementation.
We prioritize projects that align with the following:
Imminent threats to species or populations
Direct actions that are likely to prevent extinction
Strong evidence justifying the urgency
Time-sensitive projects requiring weeks-to-months for completion

                                                Throughout its history, BioMarin has worked tirelessly to make a difference by pursuing bold science. Our first approved therapy was inspired by a father who refused to accept that his son’s rare diagnosis lacked a viable therapy. That relentless pursuit to change the course of his son’s future through the power of treatment is at the core of who BioMarin is today.

                                                Developers with very early-stage technologies can apply for an Exploratory Award.
All other applications under Focus Area 1 (i.e., for platform development) may seek initial funding.
Developers based in the Global South are particularly encouraged to apply.
Proposed technology satisfies all three (3) of the following requirements for an eligible vaccine platform:
The technology facilitates the presentation of an immunogen to the immune system in such a way that elicits a desirable immune response.
The technology can be utilized to develop vaccines against a variety of viral pathogens and antigens.
The technology employs a standard manufacturing process and quality control that can be utilized for different vaccines, ideally with minimal to no antigen-dependent modification.

                                                CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We're working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, which caused significant morbidity, mortality, and disruption of normal life around the world, CEPI has set out a 100-Days Mission to make vaccines and other biologic countermeasures available more rapidly in response to an outbreak of a new pathogen, referred to as Disease X. The aim is to have vaccines ready for initial authorisation and manufacturing at scale within 100 days of recognition of a pandemic pathogen, when justified by the severity of the situation. Coupled with improved surveillance, and swift use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, a vaccine or other biologic countermeasure developed in 100 days could defuse the threat of a new pathogen with pandemic potential.
The objective of Focus Area 1 is to advance vaccine platforms that can transform outbreak response to Disease X, addressing needs for speed, safety/efficacy, and access. Through proposals awarded under this Focus Area, CEPI aims to build significant preclinical, CMC, clinical, and regulatory expertise with vaccine platforms that could be leveraged for rapid adoption in an outbreak and made accessible to all populations that need them.
Eligible Viruses for Focus Area 1:
SARS-CoV-2;
RSV;
Rabies;
Yellow Fever;
Chikungunya;
Japanese Encephalitis;
Hepatitis B;
Influenza;
Measles;
Other virus - with CEPI consent.

                                                Component I awards provide funds up to $600,000 over two years for early exploratory, discovery, and/or preclinical development studies. 
Component II awards are considered for more advanced programs that generally have identified a clinical candidate and are moving into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies such as PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and Phase 1/2 clinical trials in CF patients. Component II awards are typically supported at a level of up to $3 million-$5 million for two or more years and require substantial matching funds. Only direct costs are covered.

                                                The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), a nonprofit donor-supported organization, aims to assure the development of the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF) and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
The Path to a Cure: Industry Award Program aims to support development of treatments for the underlying cause of the disease and, ultimately, a cure for every person with CF. Awards may be made for either discovery, platform development for gene delivery and editing strategies, and preclinical and/or clinical development activities that support development of treatments that address the underlying cause of CF.
Industry programs supported through the Path to a Cure will focus on two core strategies to address the underlying cause of CF:
Restoring CFTR protein when none exists, including that from nonsense mutations;
Fixing or replacing the underlying genetic mutation to address the root cause of CF through gene replacement/transfer, gene editing approaches, or stem cell therapy.

                                                The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), a nonprofit donor-supported organization, aims to assure the development of the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF) and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
Path to a Cure: Research Grants are intended to facilitate or enable the development of new information that may contribute to the development of new therapies for CF, especially projects focused on advancing CFTR repair and replacement strategies. Proposals must be hypothesis driven and contain sufficient preliminary data to justify support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

                                                The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), a nonprofit donor-supported organization, aims to assure the development of the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF) and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
MPI Clinical Awards are offered to provide support for multi-investigatorinitiated clinical research projects that have the potential to make an important contribution to the CF Foundation’s mission. Research projects may be designed to test new hypotheses and/or new methods (Pilot and Feasibility) OR to advance established results with the potential to address diagnosis, treatment, management of disease or symptoms, or the pathophysiology of CF using clinical (observational/interventional), translational or epidemiologic study approaches. Each investigator is expected to be a significant contributor to the project and share the responsibility and authority for leading and directing the project. Collaborations that bring new investigators and technologies into the CF research community will be given highest priority

                                                The European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) is the successor to the European Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (EGRVD) and the European Society against Virus Diseases (ESAVD) which have merged to form ESCV on January 1, 1997. The purpose of the society is to bring together scientists and clinicians throughout Europe and to promote Public Health and advance education, particularly medical education, in Clinical and Basic Virology.
The Society provides a limited number of Training Fellowships to researchers to enable them to visit Centers for Clinical or Diagnostic Virology in Europe, in order to learn special or new techniques that are of value for their future clinical or laboratory work. The money required for the Fellowships is derived in part from the Society’s reserve funds. In part it is collected specially for that purpose from commercial sponsors.

                                                The Fanconi Anemia Research Fund (FARF), through the Research Grant Awards, seeks to fund interdisciplinary and translational research efforts that will lead to rapid discovery and development of therapies or strategies that treat, control, or cure Fanconi anemia (FA). Research proposals must address one or more of the following research priorities:
Top Priority: to define the pathogenesis of cancers including head and neck and anogenital squamous cell carcinomas that affect persons with FA, and to develop strategies for early detection, prevention, treatment, and cure;
To understand how alteration of the FA genes and their products lead to the clinical manifestations of the disease;
To determine the causes of bone marrow failure, myelodysplasia, and leukemia in individuals with FA, and to develop strategies to prevent, treat and cure these disorders;
To identify practical and proactive management strategies that families and persons with FA can use to develop and maintain a high quality of life;
To support the creation of shared resources, databases, and technologies for the international FA research community.

                                                The Foundation Fighting Blindness (FFB) aims to drive research providing preventions, treatments and cures for people affected by blinding retinal diseases.
This program for enhanced research and clinical training is intended to support a strong pool of clinician-scientists with a commitment to clinical research on inherited orphan retinal degenerative diseases by providing support for: 
The recruitment of clinician-scientists whose research focus in IRDs has been for five or fewer years, or 
The retention of early-career clinician-scientists with prior career development support (K-type or other CDA) who have not secured ECDA 2 12/2020 support as Principal Investigator for independent research (e.g. R01 or Individual Investigator award). 
The Program will provide support and protected time to individuals with M.D. and M.D./Ph.D. degrees for career development in clinical research related to inherited orphan retinal degenerative diseases leading to research and clinical independence.

                                                The French Muscular Dystrophy Association (AFM-Téléthon) is composed of patients and their families who are affected by a genetic, rare, progressive and severely disabling illness: neuromuscular diseases. In order to fight those diseases, AFM-Téléthon chose to initiate innovative actions and a strategy of general interest that benefits all rare diseases and all persons with disabilities.
Through its annual calls for proposals, each year AFM-Telethon supports new research projects in France and abroad, particularly for young researchers. After assessment by its Scientific advisory board, the Association finances the most relevant or most innovative initiatives in the development of therapeutic concepts and the understanding of the causes of rare and neuromuscular diseases.

                                                The goal of the Frick Foundation for ALS Research is to provide research grants for the study of the understanding of the basic causes of the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder which attacks nerve cells that lead from the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body.
The goal of the foundation is to provide research grants for the study of the understanding of the basic causes of the disease. These awards are not directed to clinically related projects for patient care.

                                                The Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance (Fara) is a national, public, non-profit, tax-exempt organization dedicated to curing Friedrech’s Ataxia (FA) through research. Fara grants and activities provide support for basic and translational Fa research, pharmaceutical/biotech drug development, clinical trials, and scientific conferences.
The Kyle Bryant Translational Research Award honors its namesake for his diligent efforts to aid in the acceleration of preclinical studies to early pilot trials in Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) patients. This award is given to proposals focused on pre-clinical and clinical investigations that will advance treatments for FA.
The specific aims must target one or more of the following:
Identification of biomarkers for FA that will elucidate disease variability, severity, and prognosis; facilitate drug screening, and/or optimize selection of patients and clinical endpoints for clinical trials;
Development of tools and technologies that can: be directly used for therapy development, overcome existing obstacles to treatment and be directly applied to, or adapted for, delivery of potential therapeutics;
Pre-clinical development and testing of potential therapeutics, biologics, and devices in cells and animals;
Clinical studies of patient outcome measures.

                                                The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) is a collaborative network for clinical research, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. It's mission is to accelerate the clinical development of immune tolerance therapies.
The ITN, through its Call for Concept Proposals, accepts proposals for clinical trials and tolerance assays applied to transplantation, autoimmune diseases, (including but not limited to) type 1 diabetes, and asthma & allergic diseases. Concept Proposals for clinical trials should represent novel therapies which have a strong biological basis for inducing tolerance (requisite preclinical investigation must be complete, with encouraging results). Concept Proposals for clinical trials should include plans for integrated mechanistic studies of biomarkers of disease activity and tolerance assessment.

IWMF-LLS Strategic Research Roadmap Initiative is pledged to promote and support basic research leading to improved understanding of the cause, diagnosis, treatment, and cure for the disease Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM). Based on this strategy, the IWMF-LLS Strategic Research Roadmap Initiative was recently developed to further our knowledge in five specific areas of WM research:
Genomics and Epigenomics;
Signaling; 
Immunology/Immunotherapy; 
Bone Marrow/Tumor Microenvironment;
IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS).

                                                Each criterion will be considered in the context of how it relates to JDRF research priorities:
How does the meeting/conference relate to JDRF goals?
What is the format and agenda?
What is the need for the meeting/conference?
What is the timeliness of the meeting/conference?
What are the qualifications of the organizers and proposed participants?
What is the past performance of the meeting/conference (when applicable)?
How appropriate is the meeting site?
How appropriate is the budget?
Note that the JDRF Conference Grant does not provide individual support to an applicant for conference attendance.

                                                JDRF has led the search for a cure for T1D since our founding in 1970. In those days, people commonly called the disease “juvenile diabetes” because it was frequently diagnosed in, and strongly associated with, young children. Our organization began as the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Later, to emphasize exactly how we planned to end the disease, we added a word and became the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
JDRF Conference Grants awards proposals for the support of scientific meetings, conferences, and workshops relevant to the JDRF mission.

                                                The Jerome Lejeune foundation was founded in 1995 in order to pursue the work of Jerome Lejeune, medical doctor and researcher who dedicated his life to the care and defence of patients with intellectual disabilities. He pledged to one day find treatments to improve their quality of life, and recognised that to achieve this goal it was necessary to first understand the genetics and the disease mechanisms underlying these diseases. Hence, he pioneered, conducted and promoted medical and fundamental research that will ultimately, be the foundation for the development of drugs and treatments for patients with intellectual disabilities.
Twice a year, the Jerome Lejeune Foundation launches calls to support fundamental, translational and clinical research projects that will strengthen the understanding, deepen the knowledge and/or will explore new therapeutic approaches for Down syndrome and other genetic diseases with intellectual disability.
The Spring call is dedicated to research in both Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities from genetic origin, while the Autumn call is exclusively dedicated to Down Syndrome research. 
Research proposals should cover at least one of the following areas:
Innovative fundamental research addressing the aetiology, pathogenesis and progression of the studied disease(s) condition and will generate new relevant knowledge of the disease(s).
Translational research answering a question of major interest that can have a positive impact on the health of patients.
Clinical research including early phase clinical studies, ancillary studies based on initiated or completed clinical trials, and studies involving patients in the pathophysiological analysis of their disease. These studies should generate novel strategies for diagnosis, therapy and/or rehabilitation.
Epidemiological studies including case-control, cohort, cross-sectional and intervention studies.
Neuropsychology studies and development or application of new techniques.

the goal of the 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program is to fund innovative projects across the full spectrum of basic, translational, clinical, epidemiological, health services, early detection, disparities, and social determinants of health research. 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program include but is not limited to the following topics:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immune-therapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes • Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;
Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer.

This funding mechanism is focused on identifying, characterizing, and developing approaches and techniques that will allow early detection and/or prevention of lung cancer and gaining insight into preneoplastic processes in the lungs. The ultimate goal is to detect lung cancer at the earliest stages and subsequently increase survival and survivorship. While this list is not exclusive, general areas of interest include:
Identification and characterization of new biomarkers for NSCLC and SCLC
Liquid biopsy assays and related techniques
Improvements in risk stratifying patients for screening
Development of predictive, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers
Genomic and histological approaches to improve early detection in tissue samples
Novel imaging modalities to identify and risk stratify pre-neoplastic lesions
Studies of pre-neoplasia and progression to lung neoplasia that may inform prevention strategies
Development of pathways to increase uptake and utilization of lung cancer screening

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
In 2024, in partnership with leading patient advocacy organizations, this grant mechanism will focus on understanding the development, prevention, and therapy of resistance by supporting projects that are identifying, characterizing, treating or preventing resistance to therapies in lung tumor cells, tissues, mouse models, and/or patients. Work supported through this mechanism will address important mechanistic questions and developmental therapeutics across histological subtypes of lung cancer (including lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer) and across the care continuum including newly designed targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These studies will enhance the momentum of improving lung cancer outcomes and have the potential to increase survivorship. We encourage applications on a wide variety of topics related to understanding resistance including:
Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies for oncogene-driven lung cancers;
Biology and mechanisms of drug resistance to lung cancer therapies i.e. chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy;
Novel treatment approaches and new therapies to overcome and/or prevent resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Novel diagnostic approaches to monitor treatment response and relapse.

                                                The Lupus Research Alliance is proud to have helped support some of the early research on the first new medicine approved specifically for lupus and many promising drugs in development. Today, our advancements usher in a new era one of precision medicine, meaning the cure for lupus is now personal. You are unique. Your disease is unique. Your treatment is unique. And your cure must be unique.
The Lupus Innovation Award (LIA) provides support for pioneering, high-risk, high-reward approaches to major challenges in lupus research. Special emphasis is placed on lupus studies exploring fundamental mechanisms, novel targets and pathways, novel technologies, and interdisciplinary approaches. Both early career and established investigators new to lupus with highly innovative ideas are encouraged to apply. Early-stage investigators are eligible for an additional third year of funding contingent upon successful completion of the original grant.

                                                The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today.
The Parkinson’s Disease Therapeutics Pipeline Program advances pre-clinical and clinical development of interventions by prioritizing scientifically robust studies that will accelerate progress towards the clinic and ultimately into patients’ hands. Our strategic funding focuses on programs addressing unmet needs of people with PD with clear potential to prevent, stop, or delay disease progression or to reduce the burden of daily symptoms. As the requirements for delivering new treatments into the market depend on specialized expertise and resources, a unique goal of this program is to promote clearer paths to commercialization and market access by the PD communit.
When considering applications submitted to this program, MJFF prioritizes pre-clinical and clinical programs that may reduce, slow or prevent disabling motor or non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s not well managed by current treatments. Activities within scope of this program include:
Pre-Clinical: Identifying, validating and/or developing novel pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions through pre-clinical development from early screening to pre-clinical characterization and testing.

This award provides funding support for experienced researchers with recognized productivity – either within or outside the eczema field – to conduct highly innovative, cutting-edge investigations related to eczema. Data from this award can then be used to seek additional, larger-scale funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or other funding entities to build on these discoveries.
Eczema Champion Research Grants facilitate trail-blazing research by established investigators who have built a life-long career in eczema research, as well as thought leaders from other areas of study that can bring additional new perspectives to the research forefront.
This award also serves as a bridge for previous successful NEA Catalyst Research Award recipients by providing a funding mechanism to stay in the eczema research field and strengthen their research program and commitment to advancing our understanding of this serious disease.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) invites applications from neuroscience investigators seeking support to advance their small molecule drug discovery and development projects into the clinic. Participants in the BPN are responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools and receive funding for all activities to be conducted in their own laboratories. In addition, applicants will collaborate with NIH-funded consultants and can augment their project with NIH contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis including under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Phase I clinical testing. Projects can enter either at the Discovery or the Development stage.

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and significantly shorten their lives.  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) progression in people with T1D differs from that observed in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and residual increased risk of CVD remains after treatment of standard risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The NIH Cardiovascular Repository for T1D (CaRe-T1D) was initiated with the goal of establishing a biorepository of human CV tissue and a scientific consortium to advance and support discovery and mechanistic research that increase the understanding of CVD in T1D.  The first phase launched the biorepository and now in the second phase investigative teams will be added to form a consortium with the biorepository serving as the Coordinating Center ( CC). CaRe-T1D is currently collecting hearts, kidneys, carotid and peripheral arteries, and blood from organ donors with T1D, T2D and without diabetes.  The goal of this NOFO is to attract investigative teams with complementary interests and expertise who will leverage these resources through individual and collaborative studies to advance our knowledge of the pathogenesis of CVD in T1D.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages research on the biology of high confidence risk factors associated with complex brain disorders, with a focus on the intracellular, transcellular and circuit substrates of neural function.
For the purposes of this NOFO , the term “complex” can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder.
Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ, or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to “model” disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components and processes.
The resulting paradigms, component pathways and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification.
The present NOFO (R21 activity code) can be used for applications to develop early stage, high-risk, exploratory approaches or establish proof-of-concept where there is little or no preliminary data. Applicants proposing to develop lines of inquiry where feasibility or proof of concept has been established should apply to the companion R01 NOFO (PAR-24-024).

This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) encourages applications for the Chronic, Non-Communicable Diseases and Disorders Across the Lifespan: Fogarty International Research Training Award (NCD-LIFESPAN) D43 program for institutional research training programs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs, as defined by the World Bank classification system). Applications may be for collaborations between institutions in the U.S and an eligible LMIC or may involve just LMIC institutions if there is a previous track record of externally funded research and/or research training programs by the lead LMIC institution. The proposed institutional research training program is expected to sustainably strengthen the NCD research capacity of the LMIC institutions, and to train in-country experts to develop and conduct research on NCDs across the lifespan, with the long-range goal of developing and implementing evidence-based interventions relevant to their countries. Interdisciplinary research training that cuts across NCDs is encouraged. However, for more topical applications, the main focus of research training covered in the application must be relevant to the mission and/or interests of at least one of the participating NIH ICs, other than FIC, as stated by each in this FOA. Other NCD topics and types of training may be included as secondary and complementary focus areas.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) is to support investigators who have interest and capability to join efforts for the discovery of in vivo chemical probes for novel brain targets. It is expected that applicants will have, in hand, the starting compounds ( validated hits ) for chemical optimization and bioassays for testing new analog compounds.
Through this NOFO, NIH wishes to stimulate research in
Discovery and development of novel, small molecules for their potential use in understanding biological processes relevant to the missions of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Eye Institute (NEI), and/or National Institute on Aging (NIA) and
Discovery and/or validation of novel, biological targets that will inform studies of brain disease mechanisms. Emphasis will be placed on projects that provide new insight into important disease-related biological targets and biological processes.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages research grant applications directed toward developing next-generation human cell-derived microphysiological systems (MPS) and related assays that replicate complex nervous system architectures and physiology with improved fidelity over current capabilities. Supported projects will be expected to enable future studies of complex nervous system development, function, and aging in healthy and disease states.
This FOA is intended to encourage the further development of projects with feasibility support for the line of investigation. Applicants proposing exploratory research at the early and conceptual stages of project development may instead wish to apply to the companion R21 FOA.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to invite applications from research institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to provide senior administrators from these institutions with advanced training in the management of NIH grants. The goal is to improve oversight of NIAID grant awards and compliance with NIH funding policies and Federal research funding requirements for NIAID-supported foreign institutions in LMICs.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goals of this NOFO is to support locally relevant research in critical areas of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at Low- and Middle-Income Country (LMIC) Institutions, to enhance research capacity, and to build a network of researchers both within and across LMICs to address this critical burden. This initiative is expected to stimulate new research on the interplay between HIV and development of NCDs in persons living with HIV (PLWH). This includes exploratory studies to uncover the extent to which HIV infection influences the etiopathogenesis of the NCDs; and to identify and develop appropriate approaches for effective diagnosis, prevention, therapeutic interventions and integrated clinical care for PLWH with the comorbid conditions. Applicants should develop their studies in keeping with the NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goals of this NOFO is to support locally relevant research in critical areas of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at Low- and Middle-Income Country (LMIC) Institutions, to enhance research capacity, and to build a network of researchers both within and across LMICs to address this critical burden. This initiative is expected to stimulate new research on the interplay between HIV and development of NCDs in persons living with HIV (PLWH). This includes exploratory studies to uncover the extent to which HIV infection influences the etiopathogenesis of the NCDs; and to identify and develop appropriate approaches for effective diagnosis, prevention, therapeutic interventions and integrated clinical care for PLWH with the comorbid conditions. Applicants should develop their studies in keeping with the NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support the development of state-of-the-art projects that integrate imaging, biomarkers, digital pathomics, glycomics, metabolomics, other omic information and/or meta data obtained from platforms including but not limited to lower resolution diagnostic acquisitions and systemic biomarker results to high resolution single-cell analytics / imaging applied to the characterization of heterogeneous cell populations within tumor for improving current approaches for: (1) the early detection of organ confined premetastatic aggressive cancer, and, (2) identifying precancerous lesions associated with the development of a subsequent lethal phenotype. This FOA specifically attempts to address and improve diagnostic uncertainty in clinical decisions by improving detection sensitivity and specificity of integrated multiparametric platforms. For example, N-dimensional co-registered, cross-correlated imaging data integrated with multiplexed biomarker results and/or digital pathomics, glycomics, or metabolomic imaging using analytic strategies such as artificial intelligence or virtual reality visualization techniques. The projects supported by this FOA will collectively participate in the existing Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB) Research Program. The goals of the CIB are to: (1) improve diagnostic performance by developing methodology for the early identification of potentially lethal cancer versus non-lethal disease, (2) minimize/better manage overdiagnosis and (3) reduce false positives and false negatives.
This FOA will utilize the NIH Research Project Grant (R01) mechanism and is suitable for projects where proof-of-principle of the individual proposed methodologies have already been established and supportive preliminary data are available.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) participating Institutes and Centers (ICs), in collaboration with the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD), invite applications for implementation research focused on addressing risk factors for common noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in World Bank-defined low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States (US). Air, water, and soil pollution; lack of greenspace; urban heat islands; lack of safe infrastructure for walking, cycling, and active living; lack of access to healthcare facilities, lack of health insurance, and cost of medications; housing condition; and wide availability of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods and beverages contribute to the NCD epidemic in city environments. In the context of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), "cities" include urban centers, informal settlements, slums, and periurban areas.
This NOFO supports applications that propose implementation research to reduce the risks of NCDs in the context of cities in LMICs and/or among AI/AN populations in US cities, with the potential to equip policymakers and practitioners with evidence-based strategies for prevention and/or management of NCDs among disadvantaged populations globally. NIH defines implementation research as the scientific study of the use of strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions into clinical and community settings to improve individual outcomes and benefit population health.

Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends  to support the rigorous assessment of barriers to quality cancer treatment and follow-up care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) cancer survivors. This funding opportunity is intended to address a critical need for improved care delivery and outcomes for SGM cancer survivors. The goal is to address the disease burden in an underserved and understudied population that is at higher risk of poorer health outcomes. The NCI solicits proposals for observational and/or interventional studies of SGM survivors designed to understand barriers and/or improve care and outcomes for SGM people with cancer, using interoperable sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection in cancer care settings, where appropriate.

Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for investigator-initiated studies addressing mechanisms by which incretin mimetics, specifically glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 or dual GLP-1/ glucose dependent insulinotropic polypepide (GIP)-1 receptor agonists (RAs), impact cancer risk.  The focus on these agents is due to their reported effects on thyroid, prostate and other cancer risks, and the generally more favorable efficacy and side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics. In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the cancer biology field who may study incretin mimetic effects on diseases other than cancer. Investigators wishing to study incretin mimetics other than GLP-1 RAs or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, must justify why the agent(s) they propose to study are more effective and/or have a more favorable side effect profile than GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs. Route of agent administration (oral vs. other) is, by itself, not an adequate justification.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to solicit applications proposing mechanistic transdisciplinary research in animal models that integrates approaches across social/cognitive neuroscience with perspectives from fields with complementary approaches to the study of social behavior, with the goal of developing a testable conceptual or computational model that provides mechanistic insights into social behavior and its relationships with the onset, trajectory and impact of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and comorbidities. 
This NOFO is intended to support basic or translational research in non-human animal models, including secondary analysis of data from research in animal models. Applications including studies involving human subjects should submit under one of the companion NOFOs. Applications with observational research in humans, secondary analysis of human subjects data, or research specifically aimed at studying disease processes or evaluating clinical interventions should submit under the companion Clinical Trials Optional NOFO, RFA-DA-25-032. Applications proposing Basic Experimental Studies involving Humans should be submitted under the companion “Basic Experimental Studies with Humans (BESH) Required” NOFO, RFA-DA-25-033. 
This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available PEDP guidance material.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this NOFO is to announce support for meritorious research projects that address research questions relevant to human dental, oral, or craniofacial (DOC) biology, and diseases and conditions, through analysis of existing and publicly available genomic data, with or without other types of complementary data, using statistical and computational approaches. Data analysis for each project can be performed using existing and/or novel methods to be developed in the proposed  project(s), including methods for data and metadata mining, data integration, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) methods. In addition to analysis of existing data, experimental or in silico work is required to validate the results of the proposed analysis, or to validate a newly developed analytic method. Projects aimed at understanding oral health disparities to inform strategies for improving health for all individuals are a priority. Projects focused on investigating and/or characterizing human biological pathways to inform identification of intervention targets or defining the pathogenicity of known genetic variants are encouraged.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this NOFO is to announce support for meritorious research projects that address research questions relevant to human dental, oral, or craniofacial (DOC) biology, and diseases and conditions, through analysis of existing and publicly available genomic data, with or without other types of complementary data, using statistical and computational approaches. Data analysis for each project can be performed using existing and/or novel methods to be developed in the proposed  project(s), including methods for data and metadata mining, data integration, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) methods. In addition to analysis of existing data, experimental or in silico work is required to validate the results of the proposed analysis , or to validate a newly developed analytic method. Projects aimed at understanding oral health disparities to inform strategies for improving health for all individuals are a priority. Projects focused on investigating and/or characterizing human biological pathways to inform identification of intervention targets or defining the pathogenicity of known genetic variants are encouraged.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites U24 Cooperative Agreement applications that propose to establish a national Open Measurement Coordinating Network for Non-Pharmacological Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD) Primary Prevention Trials. The Network will serve as a centralized hub for developing, validating, standardizing, and disseminating measures and measurement methods for AD/ADRD primary prevention trials. It will incorporate measures and measurement methods across neuropsychological, biomarker, and functional domains to meet the goal of primary prevention of AD/ADRD centered around brain health equity. Brain health equity is the fair distribution of brain health determinants, outcomes, and resources within and between segments of the population, regardless of social standing. Measures and measurement methods of interest will test outcomes and mechanisms of action (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, structural/social, computational, biological) that are customized for individuals with different needs and that are linked to real-world function. Resources developed through this initiative, including measurement instruments, methods, algorithms, code, documentation, and normative data, are intended to enable future measures and measurement-methods-development projects that support AD/ADRD primary prevention research needs. 
The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is particularly interested in proposals that aim to advance equity for populations disproportionately impacted by AD/ADRD.

This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) invites research projects that seek to explain the underlying mechanisms, processes, and trajectories of social relationships and how these factors affect outcomes in human health, illness, recovery, and overall wellbeing. Types of projects submitted under this FOA include mechanistic studies that are classified as clinical trials. Mechanistic studies are defined as studies with the objective to understand the mechanism(s) of action of an intervention, a biological or behavioral process, or the pathophysiology of a disease/condition. Clinical trials that propose to influence a clinical outcome, test safety or feasibility of an intervention, demonstrate the clinical efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention, or analyze the effect size of an intervention on clinical outcomes are ineligible for this FOA. Types of studies that should submit under this FOA include clinical trials that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes in humans for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind. Researchers proposing basic science experimental studies involving human participants should consider this FOA’s companion for basic experimental studies with humans, PAR-21-349, “Research on Health, Wellbeing, Illness, and Recovery (R01 Basic Experimental Studies with Humans Required).” Applications proposing studies that include, but are not limited to, model animal research or observational studies involving humans should submit under the companion FOA, PAR-21-350, "Research on Biopsychosocial Factors of Social Connectedness and Isolation on Health, Wellbeing, Illness, and Recovery (R01 Clinical Trials Not Allowed).

The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to invite applications that bundle independent protocols for phase 1 clinical trials with phase 1b/phase 2a clinical trials to streamline the early-stage evaluation of promising pharmacological interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Candidate interventions evaluated through this program, which can include small molecules or biologics for example, must engage non-amyloid/non-tau mechanisms and aim to address cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals across the spectrum, from pre-symptomatic to more severe stages of disease. This NOFO uses a phased award activity code. Applications must include prespecified, go/no-go safety and tolerability milestones that must be met to advance from phase 1 to latter stages of clinical development.

This Small Research Grant (R03) program will support meritorious projects to provide needed scientific insight to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and/or care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). Specifically, this NOFO will support projects covering a wide range of topics related to AD/ADRD. The overall goal of this NOFO is (i) to encourage the next generation of researchers to pursue research and academic careers in AD/ADRD research; and (ii) to stimulate established researchers who have not had a major award in AD/ADRD research to perform pilot studies to develop new, innovative AD/ADRD research programs that leverage and build upon their existing expertise. Individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups are always encouraged to apply for NIH support. Investigators who have not successfully competed for an award under this or prior versions of this announcement are specifically encouraged to apply.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goal of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO R01) is to encourage research to explore mechanisms of inflammasome activation and their link to neurocognitive disorder (NCD) and immune function in people with HIV and substance use disorders (SUDs). This NOFO supports studies to (1) elucidate the role and the underlying mechanisms of inflammasomes in virus and drug-induced immune activation, (2) identify molecular markers associated with inflammasome pathways in NCD and 3) illuminate the cellular and tissue microenvironments that influence inflammasomes in HIV-1 infection or disease progression among individuals with SUD. Overall goal of this program is to facilitate translation of inflammasome research findings into therapeutic tools that improve clinical outcomes in people with HIV.

Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute intends to support basic and translational research that will guide the development of a prophylactic or therapeutic Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) vaccine. A prophylactic KSHV vaccine could prevent primary KSHV infection, transmission, and subsequent development of KS and other KSHV-associated syndromes such as multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), or ameliorate the severity of disease. A therapeutic KSHV vaccine could be helpful in preventing or treating KSHV disease in people already infected with KSHV. The U01 research projects funded through this NOFO will form a cooperative group, the KSHV Vaccine Development Consortium (KVDC).

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) supports preclinical and early phase clinical research, as well as correlative studies, directly related to advancements in cancer treatment, diagnosis, prevention, comparative oncology, symptom management, or reduction of cancer disparities. This includes (but is not limited to) development and testing of the following: new molecular agents or biologics for cancer treatment; management strategies for cancer-related symptoms or treatment-related toxicity; cancer screening or diagnostic tools, such as imaging techniques; cancer preventive agents or approaches; predictive and prognostic biomarkers for patient selection or stratification; clinically relevant in vivo or in vitro tumor models (including genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenograft models, organoids, and cell lines); and strategies to address therapeutic outcome disparities among underserved populations. In addition to novel agents, new treatment strategies may involve repurposed agents or novel combinations of interventions (including radiation), based on established mechanisms of action. Comparative correlative studies in cancer patients with age, gender, racial/ethnic, or health disparities are encouraged to explore mechanisms underlying their differential responses (efficacy and toxicity) and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Comparative oncology studies in dogs investigating strategies for treatment and diagnosis of human disease are supported as well.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage applications for studies that will enhance knowledge of mechanisms associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). The findings are expected to advance mechanistic understanding of both biobehavioral and neurobiological pathways leading to NPS. Findings may also provide insight into novel therapeutic targets that can be advanced into interventions to treat and prevent the development of NPS in AD and/or ADRD.
This NOFO uses the R21 mechanism, while the companion PAR-23-207 uses the R01 grant mechanism. Investigators proposing high risk/high reward projects that lack preliminary data may be more appropriate for the R21 mechanism, while applicants with preliminary data who seek longer-term funding should apply using the R01 mechanism.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goal of this program is to support collaborative translational research projects aligned with NIH efforts to enhance the translation of basic biological discoveries into clinical applications that improve health. It encourages high quality science demonstrating the potential to result in understanding an important disease process or lead to new therapeutic interventions, diagnostics, or prevention strategies within the research interests and priorities of the participating NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs).
Examples of the special resources of the Clinical Center include:
Large cohorts of patients, including studies of >500 rare diseases;
The manufacturing and use of newly designed PET ligands for imaging studies;
The availability of blood products for special research studies;
Collaborative opportunities on clinical protocols (http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/) on unique pharmaceutical agents and/or other modes of therapy, or extraordinarily rare diseases with investigators who are known experts;
A robust training curriculum in clinical research;
The ability to support long-term clinical studies at minimal cost to patients and their families.
On-campus amenities (e.g., Family Lodge and Children's Inn) to assist patients and families in supportive, home-like environments as they leave their own homes to participate in clinical research; and
A number of other resources.

                                                The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) is a non-profit organization with a mission to drive efforts to cure psoriatic disease and improve the lives of those affected.
The Bridge Grants aim to support researchers who have submitted meritorious but unfunded K-type (career development) and R-type applications to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), or similar funding body, with a focus on psoriatic disease or related comorbidities. Through this special opportunity, NPF provides a critical year of additional support to near-miss applicants so that they can collect data that strengthens a future application.

                                                The Scleroderma Foundation (SF) is the national organization for people with scleroderma and their families and friends. The Foundation is also a leading nonprofit supporter of scleroderma research. The Scleroderma Foundation is interested in fostering development of innovative and high quality research by new and established investigators in fields related to systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma).
The SF through the Established Investigator Grant Program seeks applications from promising established investigators both inside and outside the field of scleroderma research who wish to propose pilot studies to obtain preliminary data dealing with a highly innovative and/or highly relevant theme related to the disease. The Grant will support pilot research that is likely to lead to more substantial unlimited research project grants from federal or non-federal sources.

                                                The Thrasher Research Fund aims to provide grants for clinical, hypothesis-driven research that offers substantial promise for meaningful advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases, particularly research that offers broad-based applications.
The E.W. "Al" Thrasher Awards aim to improve children's health through medical research, with an emphasis on projects that have the potential to translate into clinically meaningful results within a few years. Ideal applications for the Award address significant health problems, offering the potential for practical solutions to these problems. Such solutions should be innovative and have the potential for broad applicability with low barriers to implementation.

                                                The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation aims to promote research and education for the diagnosis, treatment and cure of mitochondrial disorders and to provide support to affected individuals and families.
The UMDF Trustees have identified training and supporting the mitochondrial disease research community as a priority for the current grant funding cycle. As such, both Postdoctoral Fellows and Independent Investigators will be eligible for awards under this Research Grant Program. The Foundation’s goal is to both aid in the development of the next generation of scientists dedicated to mitochondrial disease research as well as stimulating new directions for more senior researchers. A second identified priority is Clinical Trial Readiness to facilitate the development of treatments through improved design and execution of clinical studies
Projects relating to any form of mitochondrial disease are welcomed in the following research categories:
Basic Science;
Translational Research;
Clinical Research;
Clinical Trial Readiness.

                                                The World Diabetes Foundation (WDF) is an independent, non-profit foundation based in Bagsværd, Denmark, that aims to alleviate human suffering related to diabetes and its complications among those least able to withstand the burden of the disease.
WDF funds projects devoted to improving diabetes care and prevention in low- and middle-income countries included in the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of ODA Recipients.
Project proposals need to be formulated and owned locally. Projects should provide focused, replicable and sustainable solutions with the potential to prevent diabetes and improve the lives of people with the disease.

                                                The International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) is a patient-founded and patient-driven, nonprofit organization that is dedicated to a simple but compelling vision and mission.
IWMF-LLS Strategic Research Roadmap Initiative is pledged to promote and support basic research leading to improved understanding of the cause, diagnosis, treatment, and cure for the disease Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM). Based on this strategy, the IWMF-LLS Strategic Research Roadmap Initiative was recently developed to further our knowledge in five specific areas of WM research:
Genomics and Epigenomics;
Signaling; 
Immunology/Immunotherapy; 
Bone Marrow/Tumor Microenvironment;
IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS).

                                                The International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) is a patient-founded and patient-driven, nonprofit organization that is dedicated to a simple but compelling vision and mission.
To achieve its vision of a World without Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), the International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) recognizes it is vital to provide funding to support seed money to researchers for Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. The IWMF is therefore proud to announce the establishment of the IWMF Research Seed Money Initiative for Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. This IWMF Research Seed Money Initiative gives investigators around the world the chance to define objectives and test pilot hypotheses in preparation for larger grant applications through the IWMF-LLS Strategic Research Roadmap Initiative. The seed data from the projects will give investigators a better idea of feasibility and directionality of their future Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia research.
Specific areas of WM research:
Genomics and Epigenomics;
Signaling; 
Immunology/Immunotherapy; 
Bone Marrow/Tumor Microenvironment;

                                                The International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) is a patient-founded and patient-driven, nonprofit organization that is dedicated to a simple but compelling vision and mission.
In recent years we have witnessed substantial progress in basic biomedical research and subsequent clinical management of Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM). In order to achieve its vision of A World Without WM, the International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation recognizes that it is vital to provide funding to support the career development of next-generation researchers for WM. The IWMF is therefore proud to announce the establishment of the Robert A. Kyle Career Development Award Program, which recognizes the 50+ years of impactful contributions by Dr. Robert Kyle to the field of plasma cells disorders and WM.
Specific areas of WM research:
Genomics and Epigenomics;
Signaling; 
Immunology/Immunotherapy; 
Bone Marrow/Tumor Microenvironment;
IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS).

                                                Michelson Found Animals is a nonprofit with a focused mission: saving pets, enriching lives.
The Michelson Grants in Reproductive Biology is a program that exists to incentivize research through grant funding to rapidly develop a permanent, single-dose, nonsurgical sterilant for male and female cats and dogs. A proposed project must pursue a technology, mechanism, or pathway representing an innovative approach to nonsurgical sterilization. Investigators are encouraged to submit for "proof of concept" studies in cell culture or rodents (in certain cases), and/or in dogs and cats.

                                                The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) was founded in 1907 by a group of eleven physicians and scientists interested in research to further the investigation and spread the knowledge of cancer. Today, AACR accelerates progress toward the prevention and cure of cancer by promoting research, education, communication, and advocacy.
The inaugural AACR-KidneyCAN Kidney Cancer Innovation and Discovery Grants is a new grant mechanism that seeks to stimulate creative approaches to translate basic research into new treatment options for kidney cancer. Applications are invited from researchers currently in the field as well as investigators with experience in other areas of cancer or biomedical research who have promising ideas and approaches that can be applied to kidney cancer research. These grants will support basic, translational, and/or clinical research projects that examine important and druggable novel targets and/or biomarkers that are relevant for kidney cancer.

                                                The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) was founded in 1907 by a group of eleven physicians and scientists interested in research to further the investigation and spread the knowledge of cancer. Today, AACR accelerates progress toward the prevention and cure of cancer by promoting research, education, communication, and advocacy.
The AACR-Lobular Breast Cancer Alliance-Deborah Mueller Foundation Fund Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Innovation and Discovery Grants is a new grant mechanism intended to stimulate and develop creative, paradigm-shifting ideas in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) to encourage translation into new treatment options that may not be funded through conventional channels. The grants are named for and in honor of Dr. Deborah Mueller, a devoted board member of the LBCA who died precipitously of metastatic ILC. Applications are invited from researchers currently in the field as well as investigators with experience in other areas of cancer or biomedical research.

ACG's vision is to be the pre-eminent professional organization that champions the evolving needs of clinicians in the delivery of high quality, evidence-based, and compassionate health care to gastroenterology patients.
The International GI Training Grant provides partial financial support to physicians outside of the United States and Canada to receive clinical or clinical research training or education in Gastroenterology and Hepatology in selected medical training centers in North America. The funding is provided so that an individual can acquire or develop new cognitive knowledge or a technical skill. This newly acquired knowledge or skill would then be used to improve patient care in the applicant’s geographic area.

                                                Throughout its history, BioMarin has worked tirelessly to make a difference by pursuing bold science. Our first approved therapy was inspired by a father who refused to accept that his son’s rare diagnosis lacked a viable therapy. That relentless pursuit to change the course of his son’s future through the power of treatment is at the core of who BioMarin is today.

                                                CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We're working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, which caused significant morbidity, mortality, and disruption of normal life around the world, CEPI has set out a 100-Days Mission to make vaccines and other biologic countermeasures available more rapidly in response to an outbreak of a new pathogen, referred to as Disease X. The aim is to have vaccines ready for initial authorisation and manufacturing at scale within 100 days of recognition of a pandemic pathogen, when justified by the severity of the situation. Coupled with improved surveillance, and swift use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, a vaccine or other biologic countermeasure developed in 100 days could defuse the threat of a new pathogen with pandemic potential.
The objective of Focus Area 1 is to advance vaccine platforms that can transform outbreak response to Disease X, addressing needs for speed, safety/efficacy, and access. Through proposals awarded under this Focus Area, CEPI aims to build significant preclinical, CMC, clinical, and regulatory expertise with vaccine platforms that could be leveraged for rapid adoption in an outbreak and made accessible to all populations that need them.
Eligible Viruses for Focus Area 1:
SARS-CoV-2;
RSV;
Rabies;
Yellow Fever;
Chikungunya;
Japanese Encephalitis;
Hepatitis B;
Influenza;
Measles;
Other virus - with CEPI consent.

                                                The Fund for Innovation in Development (FID) supports innovation that contributes to reducing global poverty and inequality. Through flexible grant funding, the fund enables innovators and researchers to test new ideas, build rigorous evidence of what works, and scale the highest-impact and most cost-effective solutions. The Call for Proposals invites innovators and researchers from around the world to apply for grant funding to more effectively or efficiently address poverty and inequality. 
FID's Call for Proposals accepts applications for innovations in any sector which addresses poverty and inequality, and specifically encourages applications for innovations in education, health, climate change, and gender equality. Within each sector, FID particularly encourages applications centered on interventions that improve outcomes for marginalized groups, including, for example, women and girls, underrepresented minorities, and refugees and displaced persons.

                                                The earliest wish for Halcyon was to create a haven for the people who need it most. Equipped with the right tools and community, they could realize incredible, world-changing ideas that might not otherwise see the light of day. The success of the Halcyon Incubator, first launched in 2014, led to the establishment of Halcyon as an independent 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in 2017.

                                                The Lupus Research Alliance is proud to have helped support some of the early research on the first new medicine approved specifically for lupus and many promising drugs in development. Today, our advancements usher in a new era one of precision medicine, meaning the cure for lupus is now personal. You are unique. Your disease is unique. Your treatment is unique. And your cure must be unique.
The Lupus Innovation Award (LIA) provides support for pioneering, high-risk, high-reward approaches to major challenges in lupus research. Special emphasis is placed on lupus studies exploring fundamental mechanisms, novel targets and pathways, novel technologies, and interdisciplinary approaches. Both early career and established investigators new to lupus with highly innovative ideas are encouraged to apply. Early-stage investigators are eligible for an additional third year of funding contingent upon successful completion of the original grant.

                                                The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is an independent, coeducational, privately endowed university. The mission of the MIT is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the twenty-first century. The Institute is also driven to bring knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges.
Antimicrobial resistance - which for the purpose of this Challenge, refers specifically to resistance of bacteria to antibiotics - is a One Health crisis threatening health, food, and environmental security. Although national action plans have been drawn up to mitigate antimicrobial resistance, investment in research and development is being reinvigorated, and support for laboratory infrastructure in some low-income countries has contributed to increased surveillance, much remains to be done. Our current understanding of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic use, access, and quality, comes almost exclusively from high-income country hospital and industry settings. Community-level data across the One Health spectrum in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is a major untouched gap.
The Trinity Challenge on Antimicrobial Resistance seeks solutions which fall into one or more of the following Challenge Objectives:  
Innovation to identify new sources of data, collection, and analysis
Integration of existing and novel data sets with citizen-related data (CRD)
Implementation of more effective policy and action on antimicrobial resistance by using these tools

                                                The Mercatus Center at George Mason University is the world’s premier university source for market-oriented ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. A university-based research center, the Mercatus Center advances knowledge about how markets work to improve people’s lives by training graduate students, conducting research, and applying economics to offer solutions to society’s most pressing problems.
The Frédéric Bastiat Fellowship is a one-year, competitive fellowship program awarded to graduate students attending master’s, juris doctoral, and doctoral programs in a variety of fields. The aim of this fellowship is to introduce students to the Austrian, Virginia, and Bloomington schools of political economy as academic foundations for contemporary policy analysis, policy-relevant academic research, and other applied topics. Fellows will explore how this framework is utilized for a variety of topics (including entrepreneurship, technological innovation, regulation, immigration, natural disasters and military conflicts, and federal and state fiscal policy) during a series of colloquia where they will interact with Mercatus scholars that work on policy analysis and policy-relevant academic research.

This award provides funding support for experienced researchers with recognized productivity – either within or outside the eczema field – to conduct highly innovative, cutting-edge investigations related to eczema. Data from this award can then be used to seek additional, larger-scale funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or other funding entities to build on these discoveries.
Eczema Champion Research Grants facilitate trail-blazing research by established investigators who have built a life-long career in eczema research, as well as thought leaders from other areas of study that can bring additional new perspectives to the research forefront.
This award also serves as a bridge for previous successful NEA Catalyst Research Award recipients by providing a funding mechanism to stay in the eczema research field and strengthen their research program and commitment to advancing our understanding of this serious disease.

Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The NIH INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE (INCLUDE) Project seeks to improve health and quality-of-life for individuals with Down syndrome. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages Exploratory/Developmental Phased Innovation (R61/R33) grant applications to support development of clinical trials to treat critical and co-occurring health conditions in individuals with Down syndrome. The proposed research aims should be milestone-driven. The total project period for an application submitted in response to this FOA may not exceed five years. This FOA provides support for up to two years (R61 phase) for preliminary/developmental/planning studies, followed by possible transition to clinical trial support (R33) of up to three years, although the total duration of the award may not exceed five years. This FOA requires measurable R61 milestones.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this funding opportunity is to support the development of Clinical Outcome Assessments (COA) for Substance Use Disorders (SUD). The COA development plan is expected to progress into the FDA drug development tool qualification program.
This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) utilizes the UG3/UH3 Phased Innovation Awards Cooperative Agreement grant mechanism that includes two phases. The applications responding to this NOFO should contain a COA development plan that will cover both UG3 and UH3 phases. In the first 2-year UG3 phase the project must have a set of operational milestones to be completed by the end of this period. Once NIDA program has evaluated the progress of the UG3 phase and determined that the UG3 phase has been successfully completed, it transitions to the UH3 phase to be funded for three additional years. The goal of this NOFO is to expand the armamentarium of COA that are FDA qualified as drug development tool (DDT) in the context of use (COI) of a SUD.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to invite exploratory/developmental research grant applications (R21) for innovative informatics methods and algorithms to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, or interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects with a significant level of data generation and/or data analysis will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.

The purpose of this reissued Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support high-risk, high-impact, early discovery research on vaccine approaches to prevent acquisition of or ongoing infection by HIV. In keeping with the high-risk, high-impact nature of this research, this NOFO supports a Go/No-Go approach to funding high risk research, which is significantly different from most R01 projects. Continued funding for the full award duration is dependent upon achieving negotiated “Go/No-Go” criteria by the end of Year 2.

The goal of the FOA is to promote a significant improvement in the translational relevance of animal models or ex vivo systems that will be utilized to facilitate future development of neurotherapeutics. Ideally, models proposed for this FOA would have the potential to provide feasible and meaningful assessments of efficacy following therapeutic intervention that would be applicable in both preclinical and clinical settings. 
Applicants can access the FOA here: R61/R33.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits grant applications proposing exploratory research projects focused on the early-stage development of highly innovative technologies offering novel molecular or cellular analysis capabilities for basic, clinical, or epidemiological cancer research. The emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel capabilities involving a high degree of technical innovation for targeting, probing, or assessing molecular and cellular features of cancer biology. Well-suited applications must offer the potential to accelerate and/or enhance research in the areas of cancer biology, early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, control, epidemiology, and/or address issues associated with cancer health disparities. Technologies proposed for development may be intended to have widespread applicability but must be focused on improving molecular and/or cellular characterizations of cancer biology. Projects proposing the application of existing technologies where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical target/question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The funding opportunity announcement (FOA) focuses on sensitivity and tolerance mechanisms underlying the development of alcohol use disorder. The intent of the FOA is to: (1) develop hypotheses about cellular, molecular or network mechanisms that regulate sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol, and (2) develop quantitative models to predict the development of tolerance and the progression to alcohol use disorder. These objectives will be accomplished with a Phased Innovation (R21/R33) mechanism, clinical trial optional, in which secondary data analysis or pilot studies can occur during the R21 phase, and research testing the hypotheses can be expanded in the R33 phase. 
Applicants can access the FOA here: R21/R33.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage clinical research that will identify and validate novel targets for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and substance use disorder (SUD)-relevant neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses to NIBS that may precede clinical outcomes like reduced craving or substance use.
This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available PEDP guidance material.
R61/R33: This NOFO uses a R61/R33 Phased Innovation award activity code to support applications that are expected to be exploratory and developmental in nature. As such, these studies may involve considerable risk of failure but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area that could have a major impact on SUD research involving NIBS.
R01: Types of studies that should submit under this NOFO include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage clinical research that will identify and validate
Novel targets for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to treat substance use disorders (SUD);
Substance use disorder (SUD)-relevant neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses to NIBS that may precede clinical outcomes like reduced craving or substance use.
Applications are expected to be exploratory and developmental in nature. As such, these studies may involve considerable risk of failure but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area that could have a major impact on SUD research involving NIBS. This NOFO uses a R61/R33 Phased Innovation award activity code to support applications that propose Basic Experimental Studies Involving Humans (BESH) that meet both the definition of basic research and the NIH definition of a clinical trial. 
Types of studies that should submit under this NOFO include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage exploratory/developmental research applications that propose to study the development, validation, feasibility, and effectiveness of innovative mobile health (mHealth) interventions or tools specifically suited for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that utilize new or emerging technology, platforms, systems, and/or analytics. The overall goal of the program is to catalyze innovation through multidisciplinary research that addresses global health problems, develop an evidence base for the use of mHealth technology to improve clinical and public health outcomes, and strengthen mHealth research capacity in LMICs.
This FOA provides support for up to two years (R21 phase) for technology development and feasibility studies, followed by a possible transition to expanded research support (R33 phase) for validation, larger-scale feasibility, and effectiveness studies. Transition to the R33 depends on the completion of applicant-defined milestones, as well as program priorities and the availability of funds. All applicants must address both the R21 and R33 phases.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support the development of classic psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin, LSD), empathogens (e.g., MDMA), dissociatives (e.g., ketamine and related compounds), and other hallucinogens (e.g., ibogaine and its analogues) (henceforth “psychedelics”) as new treatment options for Substance Use Disorder (SUD). There is an urgent need to develop novel treatments for SUD in light of the escalating rates of substance use, addiction, and overdose. Psychedelics may offer a new potential therapeutic use in SUD. Applications may include the evaluation of an existing psychedelic, a new formulation, or a new psychedelic compound. The application can be at a preclinical and/or clinical phase of medication development.
This NOFO utilizes the UG3/UH3 Phased Innovation Awards Cooperative Agreement grant mechanism that includes two phases. The applications responding to this funding opportunity should present a research plan that will cover both the UG3 and UH3 phases. In the 2-year UG3 phase, the project will have a set of milestones to be completed by the end of this period. Once the UG3 phase has been successfully completed, the project may transition to the UH3 phase and may be funded for up to three additional years. The ultimate goal is to advance the development of safe and effective treatments for SUDs with psychedelics in the FDA approval pathway.  
Investigators submitting to this NOFO must address both UG3 and UH3 phases.

The Cooperative Agreement will build upon the extensive experience of an institution with well-established and globally recognized expertise and quality standards for drug inspectorates of National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) around the globe in support of data-driven and science-based regulatory public health strategies and approaches. The organization's best practices should align with the FDA domestic and global priority of assuring of the integration of pharmaceutical good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspections and risk assessment activities including data modeling for a risk-based inspection prioritization and workplan.
The funding will catalyze and support the institution's activities that are focused on building a global consensus on criteria for an optimal good manufacturing practice inspection, the core competencies for Inspectors or investigators, and planning, prioritizing and conducting inspections based on well informed risk assessments within the context of the increasingly complex and evolving science and innovation in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. Based on such consensus, the institution and its network of NRA Inspectorates will work toward a systems-approach and sustainable alignment across NRA Inspectorates in training inspectors and regulatory experts in best practices for maintaining oversight of pharmaceutical supply chains.

                                                The Royal Society Entrepreneur in Residence scheme was established in 2017 to increase the knowledge and awareness in UK Universities of cutting-edge industrial science, research and innovation. Award holders support both university research and teaching to enable the successful translation of academic science into industry; grow an entrepreneurial culture within universities; and address the skills needs of industry by developing curricula that produce industry-ready graduates.
The Bakerian Medal and Lecture is the premier lecture in physical sciences. The lectureship was established through a bequest by Henry Baker FRS (PDF) of £100 for 'an oration or discourse on such part of natural history or experimental philosophy, at such time and in such manner as the President and Council of the Society for the time being shall please to order and appoint'.

The Copley Medal is the Society's oldest and most prestigious award. The medal is awarded for sustained, outstanding achievements in any field of science. First awarded in 1731 following donations from Godfrey Copley FRS, it was initially awarded for the most important scientific discovery or for the greatest contribution made by experiment. The Copley Medal is thought to be the world's oldest scientific prize and it was awarded 170 years before the first Nobel Prize.

                                                The Royal Society Entrepreneur in Residence scheme was established in 2017 to increase the knowledge and awareness in UK Universities of cutting-edge industrial science, research and innovation. Award holders support both university research and teaching to enable the successful translation of academic science into industry; grow an entrepreneurial culture within universities; and address the skills needs of industry by developing curricula that produce industry-ready graduates. 
The Croonian Medal and Lecture is the premier lecture in the biological sciences. The lectureship was conceived by William Croone FRS, one of the original Fellows of the Society. Among the papers left on his death in 1684 were plans to endow two lectureships, one at the Royal Society and the other at the Royal College of Physicians. His widow later bequeathed the means to carry out the scheme.

The Foundation is looking for individuals or teams who are unbound by convention; whose projects challenge people's thinking; who compel people to see a problem in a new light; and whose creativity and imagination redefine notions of what can be done and how.

                                                The Roddenberry Foundation was created to build on Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry’s legacy and philosophy, to drive social change and improve the lives of people around the world.
The Catalyst Fund was created because the Roddenberry Foundation believes that philanthropists, and foundations in particular, need to take more risks. As a field it is needed to do more to encourage experimentation, creativity, and innovation from each other and from those organizations and individuals the Roddenberry Foundation supports.
Note: The Fund is one of several new TRF initiatives designed to make riskier bets in early-stage ideas that have great potential.

O Horizon Europe é o nono programa-quadro europeu de Pesquisa e Inovação (2021-2027). A expectativa é que este programa ajude a fortalecer a base de conhecimento europeia por meio de pesquisas de fronteira, estimular inovações e apoiar o desenvolvimento e a demonstração de soluções inovadoras, além de ajudar a restaurar a indústria e a economia, ao mesmo tempo em que se enfrenta a pandemia de coronavírus e os desafios climáticos.

                                                A Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros foi criada em 1993 com sede em Aracaju. A Unidade tem como áreas de atuação a ecorregião dos Tabuleiros Costeiros – platôs de origem sedimentar que acompanham todo o litoral nordestino – e a Baixada Litorânea – a orla marítima, onde estão incluídas restingas, dunas e manguezais –, atingindo os estados da Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte e Ceará.
A Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros em conjunto com as Embrapas Agroindústria de Alimentos, Alimentos e Territórios e Agrobiologia tornam pública a abertura de processo de seleção de empresas, associações e cooperativas de produtores rurais e demais agentes do setor produtivo para a construção conjunta de propostas de projetos para cocriação e codesenvolvimento de soluções tecnológicas em temas relevantes à produção agropecuária para as culturas de coco e citros, por meio dos mecanismos de inovação aberta previstos no Marco Regulatório de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação.
Os interessados em participar da Chamada 01/2023 deverão elaborar propostas de projetos de inovação aberta seguindo as oportunidades de inovação listadas.

                                                A iniciativa prevê a liberação de recursos em duas linhas de financiamento: a primeira, voltada para o desenvolvimento tecnológico, destina-se apenas aos microempreendedores individuais, startups, micro e pequenas empresas. A segunda é destinada ao encadeamento tecnológico e pode contar com empresas de todos os portes.
Poderão ser apoiados, no máximo, dois projetos por uma mesma MPE ou MEI, desde que tenham escopo e objetivos distintos. 
A empresa deve ter Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas (CNAE) industrial ou ligada à Tecnologia da Informação e Comunicação (TIC) e estar em dia com as suas obrigações fiscais e tributárias.
O nível de maturidade tecnológica do projeto deve ser intermediário (nem ainda na fase de pesquisa acadêmica nem quase pronto para o mercado).

                                                Modalidades de projetos apoiados:
Desenvolvimento tecnológico: aporte financeiro do Sebrae será de até 70% da contraparte da empresa no projeto e limitado ao valor de R$150 mil;
Encadeamento tecnológico: o valor máximo de aporte do Sebrae, por projeto contratado, será de 80% da contraparte da MEI e/ou MPE, até o limite de R$200 mil. A contrapartida da média e grande empresa que participa do projeto não pode ser inferior a 10% do valor total do projeto.
Após aprovado, a Embrapii aporta, no máximo, um terço dos recursos. Os dois terços restantes serão divididos entre a empresa, o Sebrae e a unidade Embrapii que desenvolverá o projeto (os recursos Embrapii e do Sebrae não são reembolsáveis).
Nota: O recurso não poderá ser usado para aquisição de equipamentos.

A empresa poderá apresentar inicialmente apenas a ideia do projeto. Se a unidade Embrapii considerar ser viável e interessante, eles demandarão mais informações e exigirão a documentação do empresário durante a negociação do projeto.

                                                Criada em 1980, a Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) é a agência de fomento à ciência, à tecnologia e à inovação do Estado do Rio de Janeiro. Vinculada à Secretaria de Estado de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação, a agência visa estimular atividades nas áreas científica e tecnológica e apoiar de maneira ampla projetos e programas de instituições acadêmicas e de pesquisa sediadas no Estado do Rio de Janeiro.
O Edital nº 2/2024 - Programa Meninas e Mulheres nas Ciências Exatas e da Terra, Engenharias e Computação tem como objetivos apoiar projetos que visem contribuir significativamente para o desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico e a inovação no Estado do Rio de Janeiro, por meio do estímulo à participação e à formação de meninas e mulheres para as carreiras de Ciências Exatas e da Terra, Engenharias e Computação. As mulheres são sub-representadas em todas as áreas do conhecimento quando se observa a progressão da carreira, especialmente em posições de destaque e liderança (efeito tesoura ou segregação vertical). Entretanto, nas carreiras de Ciências Exatas e da Terra, Engenharias e Computação, a sub-representação já ocorre na base, nos cursos de graduação (segregação horizontal), agravando o quadro de desigualdade de gênero nestas áreas.

As atividades do CERSusChem são baseadas em 3 pilares: pesquisa, inovação e disseminação do conhecimento. Dando continuidade aos nossos esforços no desenvolvimento de novos métodos sintéticos sustentáveis, na presente proposta serão abordados estudos com foco em catálise homogênea e heterogênea. Para isso, aproveitaremos nossa experiência em organocatálise assimétrica, fotocatálise, eletrocatálise e nanocatálise usando solventes verdes, reagentes mais seguros e matéria-prima renovável. Os novos catalisadores poderão ser imobilizados em diferentes materiais, como nanopartículas, e adaptados ao processo de fluxo contínuo.

O impacto da imunoterapia no câncer da próstata avançado (CaP) tem sido limitado. Nossa hipótese é que a perda da fosfatase homóloga à tensina (PTEN) em CaP induz alterações transcricionais, que ativam a via PI3K-mTOR e tornam o microambiente tumoral (TME) evasivo ao sistema imunológico. A perda de PTEN, juntamente com outras mutações, resulta em alteração do padrão transcricional da célula tumoral, interfere com a ação das células imunológicas e a produção de citocinas, e limita a eficácia da imunoterapia.
São 2 vagas de pós-doutorado:
PD-1: Análise da Resposta do TME à Perda de PTEN
Utilizará abordagem de RNA-seq de células únicas e Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP). O candidato investigará o microambiente imunológico tumoral em CaP metastático e estará envolvido na coleta de amostras, realização do RNA-seq de células únicas e na análise de dados DSP.
PD-2: Estabelecimento de Organoides Derivados de Tumores de Pacientes com PCa Metastático
O projeto visa a utilização desse modelo para explorar a resistência a medicamentos e as interações entre as células cancerígenas e o TME. O candidato estará envolvido na coleta e processamento das amostras tumorais, estabelecimento das culturas 3D e realização dos estudos pré-clínicos, bem como co-cultura de organoides com células do sistema imune e organização do biobanco de amostras dos pacientes.

O impacto da imunoterapia no câncer da próstata avançado (CaP) tem sido limitado. Nossa hipótese é que a perda da fosfatase homóloga à tensina (PTEN) em CaP induz alterações transcricionais, que ativam a via PI3K-mTOR e tornam o microambiente tumoral (TME) evasivo ao sistema imunológico. A perda de PTEN, juntamente com outras mutações, resulta em alteração do padrão transcricional da célula tumoral, interfere com a ação das células imunológicas e a produção de citocinas, e limita a eficácia da imunoterapia.
São 2 vagas de pós-doutorado:
PD-1: Análise da Resposta do TME à Perda de PTEN
Utilizará abordagem de RNA-seq de células únicas e Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP). O candidato investigará o microambiente imunológico tumoral em CaP metastático e estará envolvido na coleta de amostras, realização do RNA-seq de células únicas e na análise de dados DSP.
PD-2: Estabelecimento de Organoides Derivados de Tumores de Pacientes com PCa Metastático
O projeto visa a utilização desse modelo para explorar a resistência a medicamentos e as interações entre as células cancerígenas e o TME. O candidato estará envolvido na coleta e processamento das amostras tumorais, estabelecimento das culturas 3D e realização dos estudos pré-clínicos, bem como co-cultura de organoides com células do sistema imune e organização do biobanco de amostras dos pacientes.

                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T.

                                                Potential applicants for AFSA funding should meet the following requirements and budget constraints:
The Principal Investigator (PI) must be fluent in English and, ideally, published in peer-reviewed English language medical journals. If applicant resides outside the United States, please indicate the budget in U.S. dollars.
The PI must be a board certified "M.D.", "D.O.", or "D.D.S." or a Ph.D. with applicable basic science research experience. If the applicant has not previously published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, AFSA strongly recommends that the applicant team up with a co-PI with research experience.
An application may be submitted with an institutional review board (IRB) pending, but the IRB must be approved before the project can be funded.
All funded projects must be capable of testing your hypothesis without reliance upon another funding source. AFSA is open to funding tag-ons to NIH-funded projects, but the AFSA portion must be clearly defined with a study hypothesis.
The methodology used to determine the required sample size for the proposed study must be provided.
No institutional overhead or other indirect costs will be paid and should not be included as part of any grant request. A letter to your institution explaining this condition can be requested if needed.
Beware that substantiative equipment costs or salaries for the PI and co-PI may jeopardize project funding. AFSA awards are intended for the collection of preliminary data needed to assist investigators with obtaining much larger sums of money from the NIH or other financial institutions.
AFSA does not fund studies related to behavioral, psychosocial, self-help, or movement therapies. If you are assessing a medication that is commonly prescribed for patients, then your project should provide new insights about the drug’s mechanism of action.

                                                AFSA was formed as a 501(c)3 charity in 1994, at a time when the NIH was spending less than a penny a patient on fibromyalgia research. While the U.S. government’s track record on fibro has improved, AFSA remains the only nonprofit dedicated to funding fibromyalgia research.
Testing therapies that may greatly benefit people with fibromyalgia is a top priority for AFSA. In fact, we funded the ground-breaking treatment trial of low-dose naltrexone, which was shown to be more effective for fibromyalgia than any of the FDA-approved drugs for the condition. However, the long-term goal of better treatments will strongly rely upon an improved understanding of what is occurring on a biochemical basis.

With AFSA’s financial assistance, we are hopeful that the following questions can be answered about fibromyalgia:
What are the mechanisms involved in producing the body-wide pain?
Why do patients wake up from a night’s sleep feeling stiff, achy, and tired? What is happening in the brain at night to make sleep so unrefreshing?
How is the extreme fatigue and brain fog (jumbled thoughts and memory impairments) related to the abnormal physiology of fibromyalgia?
To what degree does treatment of muscular knots lead to reduced overall pain and improved function?
What is the most effective therapy for targeting the muscle pain in fibromyalgia patients?
Are there medications used for other conditions that should be evaluated for treating people with fibromyalgia?
Can laboratory tests be used to accurately identify or diagnose patients?
Also, can this information be used to determine disease severity or aid in predicting more successful treatments for individual patients?

                                                The American Psychological Foundation (APF) provides financial support for innovative research and programs that enhance the power of psychology to elevate the human condition and advance human potential both now and in generations to come. APF supports original, innovative research and projects.
The Walter Katkovsky Research Grants support research on the general topic of psychotherapy. Research proposals should be directed to questions and hypotheses designed to improve our understanding based on theory or methods of how psychotherapy promotes behavioral, emotional, or cognitive changes. While the ultimate goal of the research should be to inform the psychotherapy process, its specific focus may be limited to an underlying assumption, hypothesis, or questions; and the actual design may be “clinical” or “experimental” in terms of subjects and procedures. That is, the research design may be a simulation of some aspect of the psychotherapy process (e.g., learning or exposure trials) and subjects may or may not be classified as “patients”.

                                                Throughout its history, BioMarin has worked tirelessly to make a difference by pursuing bold science. Our first approved therapy was inspired by a father who refused to accept that his son’s rare diagnosis lacked a viable therapy. That relentless pursuit to change the course of his son’s future through the power of treatment is at the core of who BioMarin is today.

                                                The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to harnessing the immune system's power to control and potentially cure all types of cancer. It funds the most innovative clinical and laboratory research around the world, support the next generation of the field's leaders, and serve as the trusted source of information on immunotherapy for cancer patients and their caregivers.
The Technology Impact Award provides seed funding to address the gap between technology development and clinical application of cancer immunotherapies. The grants aim to encourage collaboration between technology developers and clinical cancer immunologists and to generate the proof-of-principle of a novel platform technology in bioinformatics, ex vivo or in silico modeling systems, immunological or tumor profiling instrumentation, methods, reagents and assays, or other relevant technologies that can enable clinician scientists to generate deeper insights into the mechanisms of action of effective or ineffective cancer immunotherapies.

Component II awards are considered for more advanced programs that generally have identified a clinical candidate and are moving into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies such as PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and Phase 1/2 clinical trials in CF patients. Component II awards are typically supported at a level of up to $3 million-$5 million for two or more years and require substantial matching funds. Only direct costs are covered.

                                                The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), a nonprofit donor-supported organization, aims to assure the development of the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF) and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
The Path to a Cure: Industry Award Program aims to support development of treatments for the underlying cause of the disease and, ultimately, a cure for every person with CF. Awards may be made for either discovery, platform development for gene delivery and editing strategies, and preclinical and/or clinical development activities that support development of treatments that address the underlying cause of CF.
Industry programs supported through the Path to a Cure will focus on two core strategies to address the underlying cause of CF:
Restoring CFTR protein when none exists, including that from nonsense mutations;
Fixing or replacing the underlying genetic mutation to address the root cause of CF through gene replacement/transfer, gene editing approaches, or stem cell therapy.

Practitioners/clinicians who possess relevant research experience are encouraged to apply.
Collaborative partnerships between researchers affiliated with a college, university, or research institution and practitioners/clinicians with expertise in EMDR are encouraged and preferred. If the research grant is awarded, the affiliated institution must assume responsibility for and serve as the fiscal agent for the project.
The principal investigator will assume responsibility for and serve as the fiscal agent for any project without an institutional affiliation As an international organization the EMDR Foundation accepts proposals from U.S. and international researchers, however, applications must be submitted in English and budgets developed in U.S. dollars.

                                                The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical research and projects targeting one clinical indication or organ. It is meant to fund research that could lead the way to a new reimbursable clinical application for image-guided FUS within five to seven years.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research that, if successful, could have a profound impact on the field of focused ultrasound and that could change the way many conditions are treated.
Researchers in the U.S. and abroad. Brazilian citizens are eligible.

                                                The Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation was founded in October, 2006, as a small, tax-exempt organization. But it has a driving, entrepreneurial spirit, and this mission: to develop new applications for focused ultrasound, and accelerate its worldwide adoption.
The General Awards Program provides funding for investigator-initiated clinical, preclinical, and early-stage research projects that fall outside our Brain, Cancer Immunotherapy, and Veterinary Programs through a competitive peer-reviewed application process.
The program has two tracks:
The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical studies and research projects that target a particular clinical indication or organ.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research.

                                                The Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance (Fara) is a national, public, non-profit, tax-exempt organization dedicated to curing Friedrech’s Ataxia (FA) through research. Fara grants and activities provide support for basic and translational Fa research, pharmaceutical/biotech drug development, clinical trials, and scientific conferences.
The Kyle Bryant Translational Research Award honors its namesake for his diligent efforts to aid in the acceleration of preclinical studies to early pilot trials in Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) patients. This award is given to proposals focused on pre-clinical and clinical investigations that will advance treatments for FA.
The specific aims must target one or more of the following:
Identification of biomarkers for FA that will elucidate disease variability, severity, and prognosis; facilitate drug screening, and/or optimize selection of patients and clinical endpoints for clinical trials;
Development of tools and technologies that can: be directly used for therapy development, overcome existing obstacles to treatment and be directly applied to, or adapted for, delivery of potential therapeutics;
Pre-clinical development and testing of potential therapeutics, biologics, and devices in cells and animals;
Clinical studies of patient outcome measures.

                                                The International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) is a patient-founded and patient-driven, nonprofit organization that is dedicated to a simple but compelling vision and mission.
To achieve its vision of a World without Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), the International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) recognizes it is vital to provide funding to support seed money to researchers for Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. The IWMF is therefore proud to announce the establishment of the IWMF Research Seed Money Initiative for Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. This IWMF Research Seed Money Initiative gives investigators around the world the chance to define objectives and test pilot hypotheses in preparation for larger grant applications through the IWMF-LLS Strategic Research Roadmap Initiative. The seed data from the projects will give investigators a better idea of feasibility and directionality of their future Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia research.
Specific areas of WM research:
Genomics and Epigenomics;
Signaling; 
Immunology/Immunotherapy; 
Bone Marrow/Tumor Microenvironment;
IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS).

                                                The Jerome Lejeune foundation was founded in 1995 in order to pursue the work of Jerome Lejeune, medical doctor and researcher who dedicated his life to the care and defence of patients with intellectual disabilities. He pledged to one day find treatments to improve their quality of life, and recognised that to achieve this goal it was necessary to first understand the genetics and the disease mechanisms underlying these diseases. Hence, he pioneered, conducted and promoted medical and fundamental research that will ultimately, be the foundation for the development of drugs and treatments for patients with intellectual disabilities.
Twice a year, the Jerome Lejeune Foundation launches calls to support fundamental, translational and clinical research projects that will strengthen the understanding, deepen the knowledge and/or will explore new therapeutic approaches for Down syndrome and other genetic diseases with intellectual disability.
The Spring call is dedicated to research in both Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities from genetic origin, while the Autumn call is exclusively dedicated to Down Syndrome research. 
Research proposals should cover at least one of the following areas:
Innovative fundamental research addressing the aetiology, pathogenesis and progression of the studied disease(s) condition and will generate new relevant knowledge of the disease(s).
Translational research answering a question of major interest that can have a positive impact on the health of patients.
Clinical research including early phase clinical studies, ancillary studies based on initiated or completed clinical trials, and studies involving patients in the pathophysiological analysis of their disease. These studies should generate novel strategies for diagnosis, therapy and/or rehabilitation.
Epidemiological studies including case-control, cohort, cross-sectional and intervention studies.
Neuropsychology studies and development or application of new techniques.

the goal of the 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program is to fund innovative projects across the full spectrum of basic, translational, clinical, epidemiological, health services, early detection, disparities, and social determinants of health research. 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program include but is not limited to the following topics:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immune-therapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes • Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;
Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer.

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
In 2024, in partnership with leading patient advocacy organizations, this grant mechanism will focus on understanding the development, prevention, and therapy of resistance by supporting projects that are identifying, characterizing, treating or preventing resistance to therapies in lung tumor cells, tissues, mouse models, and/or patients. Work supported through this mechanism will address important mechanistic questions and developmental therapeutics across histological subtypes of lung cancer (including lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer) and across the care continuum including newly designed targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These studies will enhance the momentum of improving lung cancer outcomes and have the potential to increase survivorship. We encourage applications on a wide variety of topics related to understanding resistance including:
Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies for oncogene-driven lung cancers;
Biology and mechanisms of drug resistance to lung cancer therapies i.e. chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy;
Novel treatment approaches and new therapies to overcome and/or prevent resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Novel diagnostic approaches to monitor treatment response and relapse.

Minority Career Development Award (CDA) in Lung Cancer is considered a prerequisite for establishing independence, academic promotion, recognition as an expert, serving on grant review panels, and leadership roles. Minority applicants are less likely to receive grants, to have the R phases of K01 or K99 awards activated, need more submissions to obtain funding, and often will not resubmit proposals. As minority applicants must overcome systemic and structural barriers due to race, ethnicity, country of origin, socioeconomic status, and/or language, many leave academia which further exacerbates the lack of diversity in STEM and medical fields.
Applications on a wide variety of topics including but not limited to the following:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immunetherapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes;
Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;
Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer.

                                                The Massage Therapy Foundation is a philanthropic, non-profit 501(c) (3) organization that grants money for scientific research and community service projects, and is a resource for research education to the massage and bodywork professions at large. The Foundation is able to provide the services by individual gifts, industry support, and fundraising events.
The Community Service Grants are granted to provide therapeutic massage and bodywork to communities or groups who may have little or no access to such services and who are in some way(s) marginalized by society, with the intention of enabling such communities to achieve their health potential.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) seeks to support research aimed at holistic understanding of inter-individual or between-person differences in human pain conditions, focusing  on ‘Whole Person Health’ and enhancing pain treatment and management strategies towards personalized pain medicine. The goal of this NOFO is to support studies that focus on the collection of clinical and/or preclinical data to enable evidence-based modeling and understanding of inter-individual differences and/or heterogeneity of pain occurring with use of pain therapy/management, or with conditions such as a second pain condition, a comorbid health condition, a comorbid mental health condition, or conditions of use / misuse of opioids, alcohol or other substances.
Applicants are encouraged to develop and implement novel, multidisciplinary research approaches, and include investigators with complementary expertise to fulfill the project and program goals. Input from patients and caregivers on the goals of the project is highly encouraged. Rigorous data-driven and evidence-based research approaches supported under this NOFO are expected to provide better understanding of biological and/or biopsychosocial underpinnings of inter-individual differences, heterogeneity, and stratification of persons with lived pain experience, which would accelerate the development of evidence-based solutions toward precision pain medicine.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The NEI uses UG1 cooperative agreement awards to support investigator-initiated large-scale clinical trials, human gene-transfer, stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials. These projects are multifaceted and of high public health significance requiring clear delineation of study organization including roles and responsibilities and require careful performance oversight and monitoring.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
 The NEI uses UG1 cooperative agreement awards to support investigator-initiated large-scale clinical trials, human gene-transfer, stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials. These projects are multifaceted and of high public health significance requiring clear delineation of study organization including roles and responsibilities and require careful performance oversight and monitoring.
For purposes of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the proposed study must be intended to evaluate interventions aimed at screening, diagnosing, preventing, or treating vision disorders, or to compare the effectiveness of two or more established interventions.
The NEI UG1-supported studies are typically funded as a group of single-component companion grant awards including the Chair’s Grant, the Coordinating Center, and Resource Centers, when appropriate.
Specifically, this NOFO encourages applications for the Chair's grant, which includes the scientific rationale, study aims and significance of the research project.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) solicits R21 and R01 research projects that seek to investigate actionable synthetic vulnerabilities that can be conditionally paired with tumor responses to radiation therapy. The goal of the Precision Approaches in Radiation Synthetic Combinations (PAIRS) program is to develop radiation-synthetic combination strategies and facilitate their adoption into the precision medicine toolkit toward building new and effective anticancer treatments.

The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support data mining of single cell data sets to identify cell types, transcripts, enhancers, or transcriptional networks that play a role in HIV/antiretroviral therapy (ART) or Substance Use Disorder (SUD)-relevant molecular responses, and/or to support functional validation studies (e.g. epigenomic or transcriptomic manipulation, high throughput secondary screening) to confirm or deny a biological role for one or more of the data-mined cell types, transcripts, enhancers, or transcriptional networks in HIV/ART and SUD molecular responses.
This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits grant applications proposing to utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, or other non-oncolytic viruses and their natural products to study the underlying mechanisms of the complex interactions between microorganisms, tumors, and the immune system, and to explore their clinical potential for cancer imaging, therapeutics or diagnostics. Projects can focus on using microorganisms as anti-tumor agents, as activators of anti-tumor immunity, or as delivery vehicles for treatment, diagnosis, or imaging, complementing or synergizing with existing tools and approaches. This FOA will support basic mechanistic and preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models. Applicants are encouraged to address both the microbial and tumor aspects of microbial tumor interactions relevant to microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), tumor imaging, tumor detection, or diagnosis.

It encourages high quality science demonstrating the potential to result in understanding an important disease process or lead to new therapeutic interventions, diagnostics, or prevention strategies within the research interests and priorities of the participating NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs).
Examples of the special resources of the Clinical Center include:
Large cohorts of patients, including studies of >500 rare diseases;
The manufacturing and use of newly designed PET ligands for imaging studies;
The availability of blood products for special research studies;
Collaborative opportunities on clinical protocols (http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/) on unique pharmaceutical agents and/or other modes of therapy, or extraordinarily rare diseases with investigators who are known experts;
A robust training curriculum in clinical research;
The ability to support long-term clinical studies at minimal cost to patients and their families.
On-campus amenities (e.g., Family Lodge and Children's Inn) to assist patients and families in supportive, home-like environments as they leave their own homes to participate in clinical research; and
A number of other resources.
