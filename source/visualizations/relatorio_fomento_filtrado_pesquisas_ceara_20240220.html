                                                A Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros foi criada em 1993 com sede em Aracaju. A Unidade tem como áreas de atuação a ecorregião dos Tabuleiros Costeiros – platôs de origem sedimentar que acompanham todo o litoral nordestino – e a Baixada Litorânea – a orla marítima, onde estão incluídas restingas, dunas e manguezais –, atingindo os estados da Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte e Ceará.
A Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros em conjunto com as Embrapas Agroindústria de Alimentos, Alimentos e Territórios e Agrobiologia tornam pública a abertura de processo de seleção de empresas, associações e cooperativas de produtores rurais e demais agentes do setor produtivo para a construção conjunta de propostas de projetos para cocriação e codesenvolvimento de soluções tecnológicas em temas relevantes à produção agropecuária para as culturas de coco e citros, por meio dos mecanismos de inovação aberta previstos no Marco Regulatório de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação.
Os interessados em participar da Chamada 01/2023 deverão elaborar propostas de projetos de inovação aberta seguindo as oportunidades de inovação listadas.

                                                A Fundação LAM procura urgentemente tratamentos seguros e eficazes e, em última análise, uma cura para a linfangioleiomiomatose (LAM) através da defesa e do financiamento de investigação promissora. A Fundação dedica-se a servir as comunidades científicas, médicas e de pacientes, oferecendo informações, recursos e uma rede mundial de esperança e apoio.
A  Bolsa de Pesquisa para Investigadores Estabelecidos  visa fornecer fundos a investigadores de nível docente para suporte técnico e suprimentos para investimentos o desenvolvimento de novas informações que contribuem para a compreensão da biologia básica da expressão do LAM e da patogênese/gestão do LAM. Além disso, serão considerados os projetos que fornecem informações sobre o desenvolvimento de informações que possam contribuir para novas terapias para a LAM.

                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research.

Proposed research projects may focus on any topic related to cancer etiology, diagnosis, treatment, or prevention and may be basic, translational, or clinical in nature.
At the start of the grant term on August 1, 2024, applicants must:
Hold a tenure-eligible appointment (or equivalent, if institution does not follow a tenure system) at the rank of assistant professor (appointments such as research assistant professor, adjunct assistant professor, assistant professor research track, visiting professor, or instructor are not eligible. Applicants cannot be tenured or under consideration for a tenured academic position at the time of the application. Applicants that have progressed to associate professor appointments are also not eligible.)
If eligibility is based on a future position, the position must be confirmed at the time of application, and CANNOT be contingent upon receiving this grant.
If the future position is at a different institution than the applicant’s current institution, the applicant must contact the AACR’s Scientific Review and Grants Administration Department (AACR’s SRGA) at grants@aacr.org before submitting their application for information on additional verification materials/signatures that may be required.
Have completed their most recent doctoral degree within the past 11 years (i.e., degree cannot have been conferred before August 1, 2013; the formal date of receipt of doctoral degree is the date the degree was conferred, as indicated on their diploma and/or transcript)
Applicants with a medical degree must have completed their most recent doctoral degree or medical residency (or equivalent) - whichever date is later - within the past 11 years.
Work at an academic, medical, or research institution anywhere in the world.
There are no citizenship or geographic requirements.

                                                The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to harnessing the immune system's power to control and potentially cure all types of cancer. It funds the most innovative clinical and laboratory research around the world, support the next generation of the field's leaders, and serve as the trusted source of information on immunotherapy for cancer patients and their caregivers.
The Technology Impact Award provides seed funding to address the gap between technology development and clinical application of cancer immunotherapies. The grants aim to encourage collaboration between technology developers and clinical cancer immunologists and to generate the proof-of-principle of a novel platform technology in bioinformatics, ex vivo or in silico modeling systems, immunological or tumor profiling instrumentation, methods, reagents and assays, or other relevant technologies that can enable clinician scientists to generate deeper insights into the mechanisms of action of effective or ineffective cancer immunotherapies.

                                                The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical research and projects targeting one clinical indication or organ. It is meant to fund research that could lead the way to a new reimbursable clinical application for image-guided FUS within five to seven years.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research that, if successful, could have a profound impact on the field of focused ultrasound and that could change the way many conditions are treated.
Researchers in the U.S. and abroad. Brazilian citizens are eligible.

                                                The Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation was founded in October, 2006, as a small, tax-exempt organization. But it has a driving, entrepreneurial spirit, and this mission: to develop new applications for focused ultrasound, and accelerate its worldwide adoption.
The General Awards Program provides funding for investigator-initiated clinical, preclinical, and early-stage research projects that fall outside our Brain, Cancer Immunotherapy, and Veterinary Programs through a competitive peer-reviewed application process.
The program has two tracks:
The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical studies and research projects that target a particular clinical indication or organ.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research.

                                                Eligible teams must be comprised of independent faculty-level researchers providing complementary interdisciplinary expertise, each of which will make separate but closely integrated contributions to the research being done.
Investigators must be affiliated with a non-profit academic or research institution.
One team member should be designated as the Team Leader or Principal Investigator (PI) of the program. This individual will be responsible for the administrative leadership of the project. There should be one Project Leader per project. An individual can serve as both the PI of the proposal and as Project Leader of a project.
All project leaders must show clear evidence of an independent research program, be investigators past the initial five years of their first academic appointment and must hold a full-time faculty position at the level of assistant professor or higher.
Team members may be working within the same institution or at several institutions. Teams or team members from international sites are highly encouraged. There is no limit on the number of team members.
Applicants may only apply for one LCRF grant per cycle.
Applicants are prohibited from applying if they are currently receiving funding from IASLC or LCRF

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
Work supported through this mechanism (Advancing Therapies) will address important mechanistic questions and developmental therapeutics across the care continuum and have the immediate potential to increase survivorship. Given the specific interest in the development of novel therapies that could benefit this group of patients in the relatively near-term, a clinical trial must either be initially incorporated into the project or be an immediate result of the outcome of the research. It is expected that a program of correlative, translational research will be proposed that will enhance the understanding of these oncogenic-driven lung cancers.
Working in conjunction with IASLC, we will encourage applications on a wide variety of topics related to oncogene-driven lung cancer.

the goal of the 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program is to fund innovative projects across the full spectrum of basic, translational, clinical, epidemiological, health services, early detection, disparities, and social determinants of health research. 2024 LCRF Leading Edge Research Grant Program include but is not limited to the following topics:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immune-therapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes • Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
This funding mechanism is focused on identifying, characterizing, and developing approaches and techniques that will allow early detection and/or prevention of lung cancer and gaining insight into preneoplastic processes in the lungs. The ultimate goal is to detect lung cancer at the earliest stages and subsequently increase survival and survivorship. While this list is not exclusive, general areas of interest include:
Identification and characterization of new biomarkers for NSCLC and SCLC
Liquid biopsy assays and related techniques
Improvements in risk stratifying patients for screening
Development of predictive, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers
Genomic and histological approaches to improve early detection in tissue samples
Novel imaging modalities to identify and risk stratify pre-neoplastic lesions
Studies of pre-neoplasia and progression to lung neoplasia that may inform prevention strategies
Development of pathways to increase uptake and utilization of lung cancer screening

                                                The Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF) aims to improve lung cancer outcomes by funding research for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of lung cancer.
In 2024, in partnership with leading patient advocacy organizations, this grant mechanism will focus on understanding the development, prevention, and therapy of resistance by supporting projects that are identifying, characterizing, treating or preventing resistance to therapies in lung tumor cells, tissues, mouse models, and/or patients. Work supported through this mechanism will address important mechanistic questions and developmental therapeutics across histological subtypes of lung cancer (including lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer) and across the care continuum including newly designed targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These studies will enhance the momentum of improving lung cancer outcomes and have the potential to increase survivorship. We encourage applications on a wide variety of topics related to understanding resistance including:
Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies for oncogene-driven lung cancers;
Biology and mechanisms of drug resistance to lung cancer therapies i.e. chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy;
Novel treatment approaches and new therapies to overcome and/or prevent resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Novel diagnostic approaches to monitor treatment response and relapse.

Minority Career Development Award (CDA) in Lung Cancer is considered a prerequisite for establishing independence, academic promotion, recognition as an expert, serving on grant review panels, and leadership roles. Minority applicants are less likely to receive grants, to have the R phases of K01 or K99 awards activated, need more submissions to obtain funding, and often will not resubmit proposals. As minority applicants must overcome systemic and structural barriers due to race, ethnicity, country of origin, socioeconomic status, and/or language, many leave academia which further exacerbates the lack of diversity in STEM and medical fields.
Applications on a wide variety of topics including but not limited to the following:
Lung cancer biology;
Risk reduction and screening for early detection;
Identification of new biomarkers;
Development of more effective and less toxic therapies including but not limited to targeted and immunetherapies;
Genetic and gene-environment interactions;
Interactions and contributions of multiple factors (e.g. smoking, genetics, environment, societal factors) to disparities in lung cancer outcomes;
Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to lung cancer therapies;
Bioengineering approaches to understanding and/or treating lung cancer (i.e., theranostics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, controlled-drug release, and gene-therapy);
Supportive measures for people with lung cancer and their families;
Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate research in discovery and development of novel, small molecules for cancer. Molecules discovered through this NOFO may be used to probe cancer biology, to validate cancer targets, or as the basis for optimized drugs.
Stages of discovery research covered by this NOFO include: 1) development of the primary screen assay(s) and testing in an initial pilot screen; 2) primary screen implementation to identify initial screening hits (high throughput target-focused screens, or moderate throughput screens); 3) hit validation using a series of assays and initial medicinal chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit set.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages applications that investigate the biology and underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a significant health problem both in the United States and globally. Because of the high incidence and frequent tumor recurrence, bladder cancer exacts an outsized medical burden. While recent progress has been made in the molecular profiling of bladder cancers and identification of mutated genes, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms driving initiation, progression and malignancy of bladder cancer. Furthermore, our understanding of the biological processes of the normal bladder at the molecular, cell and organ levels is limited. Fundamental knowledge of how molecular and cellular functions of the bladder are altered in cancer will aid our understanding of bladder cancer biology and contribute to the future development of new interventions.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to facilitate well planned clinical trials across the cancer prevention and control spectrum aimed at improving prevention/ interception, cancer-related health behaviors, screening, early detection, healthcare delivery, management of treatment-related symptoms, supportive care, and the long-term outcomes of cancer survivors. Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns this can include a pilot/feasibility clinical trial if necessary, improving trial design and rigor.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) (R01/R21)is to enhance mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations addressing the roles of co-infection and cancer to shed light on presently unestablished pathways in carcinogenesis that may inform prevention and treatment strategies for infection-related cancers. Co-infection is defined as the occurrence of infections by two or more infectious (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) agents – either concurrently or sequentially – and includes both acute and chronic infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and/or other microorganisms. Preference will be given to investigations of co-infections with known oncogenic agents (excluding human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and of co-infections that engender novel opportunities for prevention and treatment.

The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to invite exploratory/developmental research grant applications (R21) for innovative informatics methods and algorithms to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, or interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects with a significant level of data generation and/or data analysis will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to promote epidemiologic research investigating novel and innovative hypotheses on emerging risk factors (biological, environmental, and social) and their interplay with established risk factors (e.g., viral hepatitis) associated with the development of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma and other histological subtypes) in the United States.
Areas of research interest include, but are not limited to the following:
The role of non-viral risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, NASH, metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, and other environmental factors) and liver cancer (HCC and non-HCC) risk;
The role of metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and influence of other risk factors in the progression of fatty liver, NASH, and cirrhosis to the development of liver cancer;
The interactions of multiple risk factors (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, metabolic syndrome, smoking, host genomics and immunologic responses) in the etiology of liver cancer;
The role of social, behavioral, and host factor determinants in explain differences in incidence and mortality rates for liver cancer across multiple populations;
Examination of novel hypotheses, risk factors, and biomarkers of liver carcinogenesis (e.g., cellular factors, telomere maintenance and length, metabolites, microbiome signatures, epigenomic alternations, gene expression and protein expression);
The role of pharmacologic factors (e.g. statin and metformin) and non-pharmacological supplements in liver cancer using population-based studies;
The role of blood circulating factors, possible biomarkers, and liver cancer development and progression; 
Investigation of factors that contribute to the differential risks of liver cancer between men and women.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this funding opportunity announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of exploratory/developmental research grant (R21) applications that focus on different aspects of cancer control by modifying behavior, screening, and understanding etiologic factors contributing to the development of cancer, and developing ways to control cancer. The overarching goal is to provide support to promote the early and conceptual stages of research efforts on novel scientific ideas that have the potential to substantially advance population-based cancer research, such as the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of cancer research (e.g. epidemiologic, biomedical, behavioral, health care delivery or clinical).
Specific topics in each of these research areas represent examples of research that DCCPS supports and could be supported through this FOA:
Epidemiology and genomics research;
Behavioral research;
Health care delivery research;
Surveillance research.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support the development of state-of-the-art projects that integrate imaging, biomarkers, digital pathomics, glycomics, metabolomics, other omic information and/or meta data obtained from platforms including but not limited to lower resolution diagnostic acquisitions and systemic biomarker results to high resolution single-cell analytics / imaging applied to the characterization of heterogeneous cell populations within tumor for improving current approaches for: (1) the early detection of organ confined premetastatic aggressive cancer, and, (2) identifying precancerous lesions associated with the development of a subsequent lethal phenotype. This FOA specifically attempts to address and improve diagnostic uncertainty in clinical decisions by improving detection sensitivity and specificity of integrated multiparametric platforms. For example, N-dimensional co-registered, cross-correlated imaging data integrated with multiplexed biomarker results and/or digital pathomics, glycomics, or metabolomic imaging using analytic strategies such as artificial intelligence or virtual reality visualization techniques. The projects supported by this FOA will collectively participate in the existing Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB) Research Program. The goals of the CIB are to: (1) improve diagnostic performance by developing methodology for the early identification of potentially lethal cancer versus non-lethal disease, (2) minimize/better manage overdiagnosis and (3) reduce false positives and false negatives.
This FOA will utilize the NIH Research Project Grant (R01) mechanism and is suitable for projects where proof-of-principle of the individual proposed methodologies have already been established and supportive preliminary data are available.

Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends  to support the rigorous assessment of barriers to quality cancer treatment and follow-up care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) cancer survivors. This funding opportunity is intended to address a critical need for improved care delivery and outcomes for SGM cancer survivors. The goal is to address the disease burden in an underserved and understudied population that is at higher risk of poorer health outcomes. The NCI solicits proposals for observational and/or interventional studies of SGM survivors designed to understand barriers and/or improve care and outcomes for SGM people with cancer, using interoperable sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection in cancer care settings, where appropriate.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits grant applications proposing exploratory research projects focused on the early-stage development of highly innovative technologies offering novel molecular or cellular analysis capabilities for basic, clinical, or epidemiological cancer research. The emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel capabilities involving a high degree of technical innovation for targeting, probing, or assessing molecular and cellular features of cancer biology. Well-suited applications must offer the potential to accelerate and/or enhance research in the areas of cancer biology, early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, control, epidemiology, and/or address issues associated with cancer health disparities. Technologies proposed for development may be intended to have widespread applicability but must be focused on improving molecular and/or cellular characterizations of cancer biology. Projects proposing the application of existing technologies where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical target/question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support extramural research to investigate and mitigate challenges facing clinical assay development and subsequent analytical validation due to preanalytical variability in tumor tissue biopsies, blood biospecimens utilized as “liquid biopsies", or other biospecimens as described in this FOA. Extramural research funded under this FOA may include investigations of preanalytical variability associated with the procurement and study of small biopsies (core biopsies, small excision samples), blood utilized for "liquid biopsies", tissue swabs, tissue secretions, pleural and esophageal aspirates, feces, or bodily fluids like sweat, urine, CSF, breast milk and saliva. Investigator-designed experiments will explore how different biospecimen preanalytical conditions affect emerging and clinically relevant biomarkers quantified by a variety of testing platforms. The results from this research program will improve the understanding of how analytical quantification of clinically relevant biomarkers is affected by variation in biospecimen collection, processing, and storage procedures. The overall goal is to expedite biomarker clinical assay development through evidence-based standardization of biopsy handling practices.
Sponsored studies to date include:
Studies demonstrating that preservation methods can impact gene expression of a subset of transcripts differentially;
Studies on the effects of blood biospecimen collection tubes, processing times, time in freezer, and freeze/thaw cycling on protein integrity;
The effects of tube type, time on bench and storage temperature on circulating miRNA detection;

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for investigator-initiated studies addressing mechanisms by which incretin mimetics, specifically glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 or dual GLP-1/ glucose dependent insulinotropic polypepide (GIP)-1 receptor agonists (RAs), impact cancer risk.  The focus on these agents is due to their reported effects on thyroid, prostate and other cancer risks, and the generally more favorable efficacy and side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics. In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the cancer biology field who may study incretin mimetic effects on diseases other than cancer. Investigators wishing to study incretin mimetics other than GLP-1 RAs or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, must justify why the agent(s) they propose to study are more effective and/or have a more favorable side effect profile than GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs. Route of agent administration (oral vs. other) is, by itself, not an adequate justification.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) aims to support research on interdisciplinary population approaches to increasing awareness of the relationship between alcohol and cancer risk, understanding and changing social norms related to alcohol consumption, developing and/or evaluating alcohol policy approaches, and the development, testing, and implementation of population-level interventions to reduce alcohol-related cancer risk. Applications that address multiple levels of consumption, such as moderate and heavy drinking, are of particular interest, as well as those focusing on alcohol use disorder (AUD) from the perspective of cancer prevention and control. Proposals addressing understudied areas are encouraged, as is attention to underrepresented minority (URM) populations experiencing cancer and alcohol-related disparities such as American Indian, Alaskan Native, and sexual and gender minority populations.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for projects to expand, improve, or transform the utility of mammalian cancer and tumor models for translational research.
The NCI, through this NOFO encourages submission of projects devoted to demonstrating that mammalian models, including organoids, tumoroids and cell models, used for translational research are robust representations of human biology, are appropriate to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for patient benefit. These practical goals contrast with the goals of many mechanistic, NCI-supported R01 projects that use mammals, or develop and use mammalian cancer models, transplantation tumor models, or models derived from mammalian or human tissues or cells for hypothesis-testing, non-clinical research.
Among many other possible endeavors, applicants in response to this NOFO could propose demonstrations of how to overcome translational deficiencies of mammalian oncology models, define new uses of mammalian models or their genetics for unexplored translational challenges, advance standard practices for use of translational models, test approaches to validate and credential models, or challenge current practices for how models are used translationally.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to develop a pediatric research data resource populated by genome sequence and phenotypic data that will be of high value for the communities of investigators who study the genetics of childhood cancers and/or structural birth defects.
Kids First has established and continues to develop a Data Resource including a collection of curated genomic and phenotypic data from childhood cancer and structural birth defects cohorts and a central portal where these data and analysis tools are accessible to the research community. Access to these data will promote comprehensive and cross-cutting research and collaboration leading to more refined diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies. This FOA is intended to support meritorious small research projects focused on analyses of childhood cancer and/or structural birth defects genomic datasets generated by the Kids First program and/or associated phenotypic datasets.

A Rede de Pesquisa de Metástase (MetNet) do Instituto Nacional do Câncer (NCI) é uma coleção de Centros de Pesquisa U54 que apoiam o uso de abordagens em nível de sistema para entender questões urgentes em metástase. O objetivo geral da MetNet é avançar nossa compreensão da metástase como um problema de corpo inteiro, em nível de sistema, para desenvolver uma imagem abrangente e coesa dos processos envolvidos. Através deste Anúncio de Oportunidade de Financiamento (FOA) , o NCI convida inscrições para Projetos de Pesquisa MetNet.Estes Projetos de Investigação devem ser definidos como entidades distintas que abordam o nível de sistemas para abordar lacunas e oportunidades na investigação de metástases para integração na MetNet e complementar a investigação em curso em toda a Rede.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute intends to support basic and translational research that will guide the development of a prophylactic or therapeutic Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) vaccine. A prophylactic KSHV vaccine could prevent primary KSHV infection, transmission, and subsequent development of KS and other KSHV-associated syndromes such as multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), or ameliorate the severity of disease. A therapeutic KSHV vaccine could be helpful in preventing or treating KSHV disease in people already infected with KSHV.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs about future outcomes, including one’s response to cancer or cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social, psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members, caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from populations historically underrepresented or excluded from biomedical and behavioral research.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of applications that propose to advance research in cancer etiology and early detection biomarkers, utilizing the advantages of the unique biorepository resources of the NCI-sponsored Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. The PLCO Biorepository offers high-quality, prospectively collected, serial pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm participants, and a onetime collection of buccal cells from both the screened and the control arm participants. Available data associated with the biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking, screening results, and other clinical data. This FOA supports a wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to, biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported under this FOA.
Specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
Identifying biomarkers of various environmental, biochemical, and genetic risk factors of cancer;
Pivotal validation of early detection blood biomarkers in pre-diagnostic samples;
Developing early detection and/or risk prediction models based on longitudinal patterns of the biomarkers;

Through this funding opportunity announcement, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) solicits applications to “Cancer Epidemiology Cohorts: Building the Next Generation of Research Cohorts” PAR. This funding opportunity announcement seeks to support initiating and building the next generation of population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts to address specific knowledge gaps in cancer etiology and survivorship. Specifically, it will support methodological work necessary to initiate and build cancer epidemiology cohorts that can address critical scientific gaps concerning (i) new or unique exposures in relation to cancer risks and outcomes and (ii) achievement of diverse populations in cohorts with the inclusion of understudied populations (e.g., racial/ethnic groups, rural populations, individuals living in persistent poverty areas, and others) with substantial community engagement.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support studies that will identify, develop, and/or test strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, practices, programs, tools, treatments, guidelines, and policies. Studies that promote equitable dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions among underrepresented communities are encouraged. Conversely, there is a benefit in understanding circumstances that create a need to stop or reduce (“de-implement”) the use of practices that are ineffective, unproven, low-value, or harmful. In addition, studies to advance dissemination and implementation research methods and measures are encouraged. Applications that focus on re-implementation of evidence-based health services (e.g. cancer screening) that may have dropped off amidst the ongoing COVID pandemic are encouraged.
All applications must be within the scope of the mission of one of the Institutes/Centers listed above.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits grant applications proposing to utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, or other non-oncolytic viruses and their natural products to study the underlying mechanisms of the complex interactions between microorganisms, tumors, and the immune system, and to explore their clinical potential for cancer imaging, therapeutics or diagnostics. Projects can focus on using microorganisms as anti-tumor agents, as activators of anti-tumor immunity, or as delivery vehicles for treatment, diagnosis, or imaging, complementing or synergizing with existing tools and approaches. This FOA will support basic mechanistic and preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models. Applicants are encouraged to address both the microbial and tumor aspects of microbial tumor interactions relevant to microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), tumor imaging, tumor detection, or diagnosis.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support basic research that elucidates mechanisms by which the human microbiome inhibits or enhances anti-tumor immune responses, and to identify potential novel molecular targets for cancer prevention strategies.
Applications should be focused on delineating how host interactions with specific microbes (or consortia) or their metabolites target immune responses that enhance or prevent inflammation-associated or sporadic tumor formation. Concentration, timing, and duration of administered beneficial microbes may alter its effectiveness and thus those parameters should be rigorously addressed in the application.
Appropriate topics for this FOA include but are not limited to projects that:
Determine how Lactobacilli species inhibit colon cancer and if its anti-tumor activity requires the induction of T-cell-dependent IgAs;
Examine how commensal microbiota affect differentiation of naïve T cells to distinct Th17 subsets that may suppress or enhance tumor formation;
Evaluate the role of colonic Foxp3+RORγt+ Treg cells in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of commensal microbes to prevent colon cancer;
Determine how modulation of commensal H2S production affects host immunosurveillance;
Examine how SCFA production may affect anti-tumor immune functions of tumor associated macrophage;
Examine how microbial bile acid metabolism affects immune responses in liver and colon tumors.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) supports preclinical and early phase clinical research, as well as correlative studies, directly related to advancements in cancer treatment, diagnosis, prevention, comparative oncology, symptom management, or reduction of cancer disparities. This includes (but is not limited to) development and testing of the following: new molecular agents or biologics for cancer treatment; management strategies for cancer-related symptoms or treatment-related toxicity; cancer screening or diagnostic tools, such as imaging techniques; cancer preventive agents or approaches; predictive and prognostic biomarkers for patient selection or stratification; clinically relevant in vivo or in vitro tumor models (including genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenograft models, organoids, and cell lines); and strategies to address therapeutic outcome disparities among underserved populations. In addition to novel agents, new treatment strategies may involve repurposed agents or novel combinations of interventions (including radiation), based on established mechanisms of action. Comparative correlative studies in cancer patients with age, gender, racial/ethnic, or health disparities are encouraged to explore mechanisms underlying their differential responses (efficacy and toxicity) and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Comparative oncology studies in dogs investigating strategies for treatment and diagnosis of human disease are supported as well.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites U01 cooperative agreement applications for Physical Science-Oncology Projects (PS-OP). The goal of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network (PS-ON) is to foster the convergence of physical sciences approaches and perspectives with cancer research to advance our understanding of cancer biology and oncology by forming transdisciplinary teams of physical scientists and cancer biologists/physician scientists. Examples of physical scientists may include engineers, physicists, mathematicians, chemists, and computer scientists. The PS-OPs, individually and as a collaborative Network along with other PS-OPs and the Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OC), will support transdisciplinary research that: (1) establishes a physical sciences perspective within the cancer research community; (2) facilitates team science and field convergence at the intersection of physical sciences and cancer research; and (3) collectively tests physical sciences-based experimental and theoretical concepts of cancer and promotes innovative solutions to address outstanding questions in cancer research.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs about future outcomes, including one’s response to cancer or cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social, psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members, caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from populations historically underrepresented or excluded from biomedical and behavioral research.

                                                The Neuroendocrine Tumor Research Foundation (NETRF), a non-profit organization, offers information and education to those with neuroendocrine tumors. NETRF is the leading private funder of research into causes and treatments of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in the search for a cure. 
The Pilot Awards are the smallest size grants NETRF awards. The proposals have usually one (or two smaller) aims that describe work requiring one year to complete. They might have only one Principal Investigator (PI) with or without collaborators. They are usually a Pilot & Feasibility Type Grant.

                                                Both new and established investigators are encouraged to apply. As we don’t have a young investigator award, we encourage the next generation of exceptionally creative thinkers to submit their ideas with potential to produce breakthroughs.
All established investigators requesting pilot funds should show how their study is a departure from ongoing funded work.
New studies may be an extension of other work but cannot overlap any funded study unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that new funding will not duplicate existing support.
Rising Tide will require the return of all issued funds if found to be duplication of other funding sources. The intent of your proposed study should be to provide preliminary data for future support from other funding sources, thereby driving new and better treatment options to market.

The duration of the award is up to five years or less as specified in the grant award letter. Rising Tide will disburse awarded funds only if the recipient maintains strict compliance with reporting and participant accrual requirements as outlined in Rising Tide’s Research Funding Terms and Conditions.

                                                Rising Tide Foundation is a charitable, non-profit organization that promotes freedom to improve quality of life everywhere.
Rising Tide Clinical Cancer Research ’s funding program is to improve treatment options and quality of life for cancer patients by funding clinical studies focused on prevention, detection, treatments and survivorship. We are seeking to accelerate and support innovative and creative studies that have the high probability to change the paradigm for how cancer is treated today. The Rising Tide grant application is the vehicle by which proactive investigators may focus directly on their cancer patients’ clinical problems and treatments that may prove successful and have a high chance to be quickly implemented in daily practice. We are particularly interested in identifying and funding clinical investigators who: 
Have outstanding anti-cancer and supportive treatment ideas relevant to today’s cancer patients with a direct, meaningful therapeutic impact for enrolled patients. 
Are driven to deliver new and better treatment, symptom management, prevention and early detection options for their patients today through clinical trial studies directly relevant to Rising Tide’s Mission. 
Have collaborated to design novel, new, or pilot projects distinctly removed from currently funded research projects. 
Are in line with our patient centric approach and have a defined Patient Engagement plan throughout the the study. Priority will be given to research where patient engagement has happened very early at the research design and is clearly demonstrated in the application.

                                                O Conselho Nacional das Fundações Estaduais de Amparo à Pesquisa (CONFAP) é uma organização sem fins lucrativos, que tem por objetivo promover uma melhor articulação dos interesses das agências estaduais de fomento à pesquisa científica, tecnológica e de inovação no Brasil. Criado em 28 de abril de 2006, congrega 26 Fundações de Amparo à Pesquisa (FAPs), e trabalha como parte ativa do Sistema Nacional de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação.
O Horizon Europe é o nono programa-quadro europeu de Pesquisa e Inovação (2021-2027). A expectativa é que este programa ajude a fortalecer a base de conhecimento europeia por meio de pesquisas de fronteira, estimular inovações e apoiar o desenvolvimento e a demonstração de soluções inovadoras, além de ajudar a restaurar a indústria e a economia, ao mesmo tempo em que se enfrenta a pandemia de coronavírus e os desafios climáticos.

Composto por  27 institutos e centros , o NIH oferece liderança e apoio financeiro a pesquisadores em todos os estados e em todo o mundo.
O objetivo deste Anúncio de Oportunidade de Financiamento (FOA) é desenvolver protótipos de dispositivos de nível clínico destinados ao uso como diagnósticos e tratamentos seguros, eficazes e não viciantes para dor ou transtorno por uso de opióides (OUD). O objetivo do programa é demonstrar o tratamento usando alvos neurais específicos para instruções baseadas em dispositivos e/ou diagnósticos para dor ou OUD, com base nos mais recentes conhecimentos mecanísticos sobre a anatomia e fisiologia das vias centrais, espinhais e periféricas envolvidas no dor ou OUD .As atividades premiadas facilitarão a tradução de novos dispositivos até o estágio de preparação para ensaios clínicos em humanos (FIH), superando os principais desafios identificados durante estudos preliminares de prova de conceito. O escopo do programa inclui desenvolvimento e otimização de tecnologia e estudos para preparação para aprovações para uso humano.

A Fundação dedica-se a servir as comunidades científicas, médicas e de pacientes, oferecendo informações, recursos e uma rede mundial de esperança e apoio.
A  Bolsa de Pesquisa para Investigadores Estabelecidos  visa fornecer fundos a investigadores de nível docente para suporte técnico e suprimentos para investimentos o desenvolvimento de novas informações que contribuem para a compreensão da biologia básica da expressão do LAM e da patogênese/gestão do LAM. Além disso, serão considerados os projetos que fornecem informações sobre o desenvolvimento de informações que possam contribuir para novas terapias para a LAM.
