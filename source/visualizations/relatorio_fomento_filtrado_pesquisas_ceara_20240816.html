                                                The Alzheimer's Association was founded in 1980 by a small group of family members caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. These individuals united in disappointment with the quality of information available to them and in dissatisfaction with the lack of medical and social awareness of this devastating condition. Two years after its founding, the fledgling organization funded its first research grant, awarding a total of about $80,000 to a handful of investigators. Since then, the Association has grown into the largest nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. Today, the Alzheimer's Association leads the way to end Alzheimer's and all other dementia by accelerating global research, driving risk reduction and early detection, and maximizing quality care and support.
The APOE Biology in Alzheimer's (ABA) Grant Program solicits projects that aim to address some of the key challenges in Alzheimer's research today as related to APOE contributions and biology, including but not limited to:
Cause(s) of the Disease;
Experimental Models of Disease;
Early and Accurate Detection and Diagnosis;
Treatment;
Tool development.

                                                The Alzheimer's Association is the leading, global voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care and support, and the largest private, nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.
The areas of research that the clinician scientist proposes for funding are not limited to patient-oriented, human subject research, but may also include translational research specifically designed to develop treatments or enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. These translational areas of research include epidemiologic or behavioral studies, clinical trials, studies of disease mechanisms, mapping disease features or spread the development of new technologies, and health services and outcomes research. Disease related basic science studies not directly involving humans or human tissue are also encouraged if the primary goal is the development of therapies, diagnostic tests, or other tools to prevent or mitigate neurological diseases.

                                                The Alzheimer's Association is the leading, global voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care and support, and the largest private, nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.
The AARF grant program is intended to support exceptional researchers who are engaged in their post-graduate work (i.e. postdoctoral fellows) and before they have their first independent faculty positions (i.e. Assistant Professor) and working in diverse areas of research, including basic, translational, clinical, functional and social-behavioral research. Investigators doing clinically-focused research without clinical practice are encouraged to apply.

                                                The Alzheimer's Association is the leading, global voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care and support, and the largest private, nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.
The AARG-D-NTF grant program aims to fund investigators who are new to Alzheimer's and all dementia fields of research. Individuals who are new to the field of neuroscience or neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lewy body dementia, etc.) will be considered for this program. The program's goal is to provide an opportunity for investigators with expertise outside neurodegenerative research to apply their expertise to advance and accelerate Alzheimer's and all other dementia research.
The objective of this award is to increase the number of highly trained investigators from diverse backgrounds whose basic, clinical and social/behavioral research interests are grounded in the advanced methods and experimental approaches needed to solve problems related to Alzheimer's and all other dementias in general and in health disparities populations.

                                                Founded in 1998 by co-chairmen Leonard A. and Ronald S. Lauder, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) aims to rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.
The Drug Development RFP supports investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies (or the international equivalent) and early-phase clinical trials that test promising pharmacological interventions and devices for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Both disease-modifying and symptomatic agents will be considered.
This funding opportunity prioritizes diverse drug mechanisms and modes of action related to the biology of aging and other emerging therapeutic areas for dementia. For this reason, amyloid targeted approaches and cholinesterase inhibitor proposals will not be considered for this RFP.

The aim of this RFP is to further develop and validate established biomarkers for which there is a clear clinical need in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This RFP prioritizes biomarkers with a defined context of use, a clear advantage over other relevant biomarkers, and a path to commercialization and/or clinical use.
Specifically, this RFP focuses on:
Developing novel PET ligands for clinical trials;
Supporting novel CSF biomarkers;
Validating innovative MRI approaches in larger cohorts;
Developing novel measures of functional activity such as EEG.

                                                The BrightFocus Foundation is a nonprofit organization that supports research and provides public education on brain and eye diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, macular degeneration and glaucoma.
BrightFocus Foundation, throught the National Glaucoma Research Grants, provides research funds for U.S. and international researchers pursuing pioneering research leading to greater understanding, prevention, and treatment of glaucoma. Preference is made for exciting pilot projects that would not, at their present stage, be competitive for large government or industry awards.
The NGR program offers two types of awards:
Standard Awards:
The standard award provides significant funding for researchers who have already generated some amount of preliminary data, but are often required to demonstrate additional, significant progress before they can apply to governmental or industrial funding agencies.
Postdoctoral Fellowship Awards:
Postdoctoral fellowship awards are intended for young researchers in their final stages of mentored training. These awards fund projects in an established laboratory that will serve as the basis for the applicant's own independent research career.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites applications proposing innovative strategies to target and manipulate brain cell subtypes that are altered in aging, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and AD-Related Dementias (ADRDs). ADRDs include frontotemporal disorders (FTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), and multiple etiology dementias (MED). 
Specifically, the goal of this NOFO is to encourage the development and utilization of sophisticated tools that pair breakthroughs in adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid engineering with enhancer element identification to do the following:
Optimize precise targeting of disease-relevant cell subtypes in aged and degenerating mammalian brains. 
Monitor and/or manipulate these cells in vivo to address mechanistic hypotheses related to brain aging and AD/ADRD in animal models.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to invite applications that bundle independent protocols for phase 1 clinical trials with phase 1b/phase 2a clinical trials to streamline the early-stage evaluation of promising pharmacological interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Candidate interventions evaluated through this program, which can include small molecules or biologics for example, must engage non-amyloid/non-tau mechanisms and aim to address cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals across the spectrum, from pre-symptomatic to more severe stages of disease. This NOFO uses a phased award activity code. Applications must include prespecified, go/no-go safety and tolerability milestones that must be met to advance from phase 1 to latter stages of clinical development.

This Small Research Grant (R03) program will support meritorious projects to provide needed scientific insight to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and/or care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). Specifically, this NOFO will support projects covering a wide range of topics related to AD/ADRD. The overall goal of this NOFO is (i) to encourage the next generation of researchers to pursue research and academic careers in AD/ADRD research; and (ii) to stimulate established researchers who have not had a major award in AD/ADRD research to perform pilot studies to develop new, innovative AD/ADRD research programs that leverage and build upon their existing expertise. Individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups are always encouraged to apply for NIH support. Investigators who have not successfully competed for an award under this or prior versions of this announcement are specifically encouraged to apply.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of applications that propose to advance research in cancer etiology and early detection biomarkers, utilizing the advantages of the unique biorepository resources of the NCI-sponsored Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. The PLCO Biorepository offers high-quality, prospectively collected, serial pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm participants, and a onetime collection of buccal cells from both the screened and the control arm participants. Available data associated with the biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking, screening results, and other clinical data. This FOA supports a wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to, biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported under this FOA.
Specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
Identifying biomarkers of various environmental, biochemical, and genetic risk factors of cancer;
Pivotal validation of early detection blood biomarkers in pre-diagnostic samples;
Developing early detection and/or risk prediction models based on longitudinal patterns of the biomarkers;
Identifying blood biomarkers that correlate with clinical behavior of the tumors, especially those that differentiate between aggressive and indolent cancers;
Correlating blood biomarkers to tissue biomarkers, histological and molecular subtypes, and clinical behaviors;
Biomarker discovery in pre-diagnostic samples using high through-put, proven technologies; and
Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis).

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage applications for studies that will enhance knowledge of mechanisms associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). The findings are expected to advance mechanistic understanding of both biobehavioral and neurobiological pathways leading to NPS. Findings may also provide insight into novel therapeutic targets that can be advanced into interventions to treat and prevent the development of NPS in AD and/or ADRD.
This NOFO uses the R21 mechanism, while the companion PAR-23-207 uses the R01 grant mechanism. Investigators proposing high risk/high reward projects that lack preliminary data may be more appropriate for the R21 mechanism, while applicants with preliminary data who seek longer-term funding should apply using the R01 mechanism.

                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research.

                                                The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to harnessing the immune system's power to control and potentially cure all types of cancer. It funds the most innovative clinical and laboratory research around the world, support the next generation of the field's leaders, and serve as the trusted source of information on immunotherapy for cancer patients and their caregivers.
The Technology Impact Award provides seed funding to address the gap between technology development and clinical application of cancer immunotherapies. The grants aim to encourage collaboration between technology developers and clinical cancer immunologists and to generate the proof-of-principle of a novel platform technology in bioinformatics, ex vivo or in silico modeling systems, immunological or tumor profiling instrumentation, methods, reagents and assays, or other relevant technologies that can enable clinician scientists to generate deeper insights into the mechanisms of action of effective or ineffective cancer immunotherapies.

                                                Applicants from all countries are welcome to apply. Applicants awarded in previous years cannot apply a second time.
Funding through the John Hansen Research Grant is dependent on the eligibility of the applicant: Applicant must have received a doctoral degree (PhD, MD, or equivalent achievements) in a field pertinent to the grant within the last 10 years from the grant call start date. Applicants whose careers have been interrupted after receiving a doctoral degree, may request an extension of the degree requirement insofar as the interruption occurred for example to one of the following reasons: family care responsibilities, applicant’s disability or illness, active duty community service. Such request for extension shall be initiated within the scope of the application phase by completing the Extension Request Form which will be provided on demand (grant@dkms.org). Upon request, the reasons leading to such a request must be substantiated by appropriate documentation. The requirement for extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Applicants must appoint a supervisor in his/her/its application. The supervisor should ideally be a senior scientist in the applicant’s host institution with experience in the research proposal topic, who can provide guidance and support for an adequate project progress.

                                                The candidate may not have had more than three years of postdoctoral laboratory research experience. (This includes any time spent conducting research during the clinical fellowship).
Applicants may apply at any time prior to their initial assistant professorship appointment (or equivalent). Postdoctoral fellows, clinical fellows, and clinical instructors are eligible to apply. If the awardee transitions to a fully independent assistant professorship appointment (or equivalent) during the award term, they must terminate the award (see Terms of the Award below).
Candidates holding or awarded NIH K awards at the time of application are not eligible to apply. (Candidates holding institutional K12 awards may apply, but must return their K12 funding to the U.S. Government/NIH if they are awarded a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist Training Award.)
Candidates must apply with a Mentor. The Mentor's role is to foster the development of the applicant’s knowledge, technical and analytical skills, and capacity for scientific inquiry in the field of basic or translational research chosen by the candidate and in which the Mentor is an outstanding figure. The Mentor will also serve as an advocate for the applicant at departmental, institutional, and other relevant professional levels.
Only one application will be accepted from a Mentor per review session (including Co-Mentors); there is no limit, however, to the number of applications from an institution.
No more than two Damon Runyon Physician-Scientists will be funded to work with the same Mentor at any given time (including Co-Mentors).
Eligible candidates may apply up to two times.

                                                The Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation funds high-risk, high-reward cancer research. The Foundation identifies and enables young scientists who are brilliant, brave and bold enough to go where others haven't.
The Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist Training Award is a program designed to recruit outstanding U.S. Specialty Board eligible physicians into cancer research careers by providing them with the opportunity for a protected research training experience under the mentorship of a highly qualified and gifted mentor after they have completed all of their clinical training. The goals are to transform these individuals into the highest quality physician-scientists, capable of conducting research that has the potential to transform the diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of cancer and to eliminate the financial disincentive to entering this career path.

                                                The principal purpose of the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation is to encourage, drive and fund research that will substantially improve outcomes for fibrolamellar patients. We envision a world where all people with fibrolamellar carcinoma will be diagnosed early, treated effectively and hopefully cured.
The research must focus on Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC) [aka Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FL-HCC)]. Studies should be intended to advance knowledge relevant to the understanding, diagnosis, epidemiology, or treatment of FLC. Of particular interest are applications showing a clear path towards a novel therapy / clinical trials with the ultimate goal of achieving a cure for FLC. The FCF will accept grant applications to support innovative and promising research projects towards the above goals.

                                                The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical research and projects targeting one clinical indication or organ. It is meant to fund research that could lead the way to a new reimbursable clinical application for image-guided FUS within five to seven years.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research that, if successful, could have a profound impact on the field of focused ultrasound and that could change the way many conditions are treated.
Researchers in the U.S. and abroad. Brazilian citizens are eligible.

                                                The Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation was founded in October, 2006, as a small, tax-exempt organization. But it has a driving, entrepreneurial spirit, and this mission: to develop new applications for focused ultrasound, and accelerate its worldwide adoption.
The General Awards Program provides funding for investigator-initiated clinical, preclinical, and early-stage research projects that fall outside our Brain, Cancer Immunotherapy, and Veterinary Programs through a competitive peer-reviewed application process.
The program has two tracks:
The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical studies and research projects that target a particular clinical indication or organ.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research.

                                                The Friends for an Earlier Breast Cancer Test is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting awareness and education and to raising funds for research into earlier detection of breast cancer. 
Friends through the Research Grants are requesting applications for pilot projects that focus on new methods to improve detection of early breast cancer and are especially interested in the development of new techniques in the areas of biological or immunologic methods of early detection. It is Friends' hope that pilot projects will provide preliminary data that leads to applications for more substantial peer-reviewed funding.

                                                The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), a  nonprofit organization, drives discoveries for new treatments, accelerates groundbreaking clinical trials and fuels the most robust data-driven initiatives in cancer research. Its goal is to find a cure for each and every patient diagnosed with multiple myeloma.
The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is pleased to announce a new Clinical Translational Research Program, the MMRF Myeloma Omics Initiative. This initiative will provide successful applicants access to state-of-the-art -omics platforms and analytical resources to analyze bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from patients enrolled in high value clinical studies in multiple myeloma and precursor conditions.
The MMRF is seeking applications from investigators or research teams that have biological samples that might address any of these critical questions:
From the initiation and evolution of malignant plasma cells through disease progression;
Tumor intrinsic molecular events that drive clinical response and relapse or resistance;
Host intrinsic biological processes that monitor and control malignant disease and the biological events that lead to the loss or dysregulation of disease control processes;
Impact of therapeutic intervention on tumor- and host-intrinsic processes and how alterations in these processes influence clinical response and relapse or resistance.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate research in discovery and development of novel, small molecules for cancer. Molecules discovered through this NOFO may be used to probe cancer biology, to validate cancer targets, or as the basis for optimized drugs.
Stages of discovery research covered by this NOFO include: 1) development of the primary screen assay(s) and testing in an initial pilot screen; 2) primary screen implementation to identify initial screening hits (high throughput target-focused screens, or moderate throughput screens); 3) hit validation using a series of assays and initial medicinal chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit set.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages applications that investigate the biology and underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a significant health problem both in the United States and globally. Because of the high incidence and frequent tumor recurrence, bladder cancer exacts an outsized medical burden. While recent progress has been made in the molecular profiling of bladder cancers and identification of mutated genes, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms driving initiation, progression and malignancy of bladder cancer. Furthermore, our understanding of the biological processes of the normal bladder at the molecular, cell and organ levels is limited. Fundamental knowledge of how molecular and cellular functions of the bladder are altered in cancer will aid our understanding of bladder cancer biology and contribute to the future development of new interventions.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to facilitate well planned clinical trials across the cancer prevention and control spectrum aimed at improving prevention/ interception, cancer-related health behaviors, screening, early detection, healthcare delivery, management of treatment-related symptoms, supportive care, and the long-term outcomes of cancer survivors. Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns this can include a pilot/feasibility clinical trial if necessary, improving trial design and rigor.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) (R01/R21)is to enhance mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations addressing the roles of co-infection and cancer to shed light on presently unestablished pathways in carcinogenesis that may inform prevention and treatment strategies for infection-related cancers. Co-infection is defined as the occurrence of infections by two or more infectious (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) agents – either concurrently or sequentially – and includes both acute and chronic infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and/or other microorganisms. Preference will be given to investigations of co-infections with known oncogenic agents (excluding human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and of co-infections that engender novel opportunities for prevention and treatment.

The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to invite exploratory/developmental research grant applications (R21) for innovative informatics methods and algorithms to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, or interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects with a significant level of data generation and/or data analysis will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to promote epidemiologic research investigating novel and innovative hypotheses on emerging risk factors (biological, environmental, and social) and their interplay with established risk factors (e.g., viral hepatitis) associated with the development of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma and other histological subtypes) in the United States.
Areas of research interest include, but are not limited to the following:
The role of non-viral risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, NASH, metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, and other environmental factors) and liver cancer (HCC and non-HCC) risk;
The role of metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and influence of other risk factors in the progression of fatty liver, NASH, and cirrhosis to the development of liver cancer;
The interactions of multiple risk factors (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, metabolic syndrome, smoking, host genomics and immunologic responses) in the etiology of liver cancer;
The role of social, behavioral, and host factor determinants in explain differences in incidence and mortality rates for liver cancer across multiple populations;
Examination of novel hypotheses, risk factors, and biomarkers of liver carcinogenesis (e.g., cellular factors, telomere maintenance and length, metabolites, microbiome signatures, epigenomic alternations, gene expression and protein expression);
The role of pharmacologic factors (e.g. statin and metformin) and non-pharmacological supplements in liver cancer using population-based studies;
The role of blood circulating factors, possible biomarkers, and liver cancer development and progression; 
Investigation of factors that contribute to the differential risks of liver cancer between men and women.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this funding opportunity announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of exploratory/developmental research grant (R21) applications that focus on different aspects of cancer control by modifying behavior, screening, and understanding etiologic factors contributing to the development of cancer, and developing ways to control cancer. The overarching goal is to provide support to promote the early and conceptual stages of research efforts on novel scientific ideas that have the potential to substantially advance population-based cancer research, such as the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of cancer research (e.g. epidemiologic, biomedical, behavioral, health care delivery or clinical).
Specific topics in each of these research areas represent examples of research that DCCPS supports and could be supported through this FOA:
Epidemiology and genomics research;
Behavioral research;
Health care delivery research;
Surveillance research.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support the development of state-of-the-art projects that integrate imaging, biomarkers, digital pathomics, glycomics, metabolomics, other omic information and/or meta data obtained from platforms including but not limited to lower resolution diagnostic acquisitions and systemic biomarker results to high resolution single-cell analytics / imaging applied to the characterization of heterogeneous cell populations within tumor for improving current approaches for: (1) the early detection of organ confined premetastatic aggressive cancer, and, (2) identifying precancerous lesions associated with the development of a subsequent lethal phenotype. This FOA specifically attempts to address and improve diagnostic uncertainty in clinical decisions by improving detection sensitivity and specificity of integrated multiparametric platforms. For example, N-dimensional co-registered, cross-correlated imaging data integrated with multiplexed biomarker results and/or digital pathomics, glycomics, or metabolomic imaging using analytic strategies such as artificial intelligence or virtual reality visualization techniques. The projects supported by this FOA will collectively participate in the existing Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB) Research Program. The goals of the CIB are to: (1) improve diagnostic performance by developing methodology for the early identification of potentially lethal cancer versus non-lethal disease, (2) minimize/better manage overdiagnosis and (3) reduce false positives and false negatives.
This FOA will utilize the NIH Research Project Grant (R01) mechanism and is suitable for projects where proof-of-principle of the individual proposed methodologies have already been established and supportive preliminary data are available.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends  to support the rigorous assessment of barriers to quality cancer treatment and follow-up care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) cancer survivors. This funding opportunity is intended to address a critical need for improved care delivery and outcomes for SGM cancer survivors. The goal is to address the disease burden in an underserved and understudied population that is at higher risk of poorer health outcomes. The NCI solicits proposals for observational and/or interventional studies of SGM survivors designed to understand barriers and/or improve care and outcomes for SGM people with cancer, using interoperable sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection in cancer care settings, where appropriate.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits grant applications proposing exploratory research projects focused on the early-stage development of highly innovative technologies offering novel molecular or cellular analysis capabilities for basic, clinical, or epidemiological cancer research. The emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel capabilities involving a high degree of technical innovation for targeting, probing, or assessing molecular and cellular features of cancer biology. Well-suited applications must offer the potential to accelerate and/or enhance research in the areas of cancer biology, early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, control, epidemiology, and/or address issues associated with cancer health disparities. Technologies proposed for development may be intended to have widespread applicability but must be focused on improving molecular and/or cellular characterizations of cancer biology. Projects proposing the application of existing technologies where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical target/question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for investigator-initiated studies addressing mechanisms by which incretin mimetics, specifically glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 or dual GLP-1/ glucose dependent insulinotropic polypepide (GIP)-1 receptor agonists (RAs), impact cancer risk.  The focus on these agents is due to their reported effects on thyroid, prostate and other cancer risks, and the generally more favorable efficacy and side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics. In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the cancer biology field who may study incretin mimetic effects on diseases other than cancer. Investigators wishing to study incretin mimetics other than GLP-1 RAs or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, must justify why the agent(s) they propose to study are more effective and/or have a more favorable side effect profile than GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs. Route of agent administration (oral vs. other) is, by itself, not an adequate justification.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) aims to support research on interdisciplinary population approaches to increasing awareness of the relationship between alcohol and cancer risk, understanding and changing social norms related to alcohol consumption, developing and/or evaluating alcohol policy approaches, and the development, testing, and implementation of population-level interventions to reduce alcohol-related cancer risk. Applications that address multiple levels of consumption, such as moderate and heavy drinking, are of particular interest, as well as those focusing on alcohol use disorder (AUD) from the perspective of cancer prevention and control. Proposals addressing understudied areas are encouraged, as is attention to underrepresented minority (URM) populations experiencing cancer and alcohol-related disparities such as American Indian, Alaskan Native, and sexual and gender minority populations.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for projects to expand, improve, or transform the utility of mammalian cancer and tumor models for translational research.
The NCI, through this NOFO encourages submission of projects devoted to demonstrating that mammalian models, including organoids, tumoroids and cell models, used for translational research are robust representations of human biology, are appropriate to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for patient benefit. These practical goals contrast with the goals of many mechanistic, NCI-supported R01 projects that use mammals, or develop and use mammalian cancer models, transplantation tumor models, or models derived from mammalian or human tissues or cells for hypothesis-testing, non-clinical research.
Among many other possible endeavors, applicants in response to this NOFO could propose demonstrations of how to overcome translational deficiencies of mammalian oncology models, define new uses of mammalian models or their genetics for unexplored translational challenges, advance standard practices for use of translational models, test approaches to validate and credential models, or challenge current practices for how models are used translationally.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to develop a pediatric research data resource populated by genome sequence and phenotypic data that will be of high value for the communities of investigators who study the genetics of childhood cancers and/or structural birth defects.
Kids First has established and continues to develop a Data Resource including a collection of curated genomic and phenotypic data from childhood cancer and structural birth defects cohorts and a central portal where these data and analysis tools are accessible to the research community. Access to these data will promote comprehensive and cross-cutting research and collaboration leading to more refined diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies. This FOA is intended to support meritorious small research projects focused on analyses of childhood cancer and/or structural birth defects genomic datasets generated by the Kids First program and/or associated phenotypic datasets. Development of approaches, tools, or algorithms appropriate for analyzing genomic, phenotypic, and/or clinical data relevant to Kids First may also be proposed.

Composto por  27 Institutos e Centros , o NIH oferece liderança e apoio financeiro a pesquisadores em todos os estados e em todo o mundo.
A Rede de Pesquisa de Metástase (MetNet) do Instituto Nacional do Câncer (NCI) é uma coleção de Centros de Pesquisa U54 que apoiam o uso de abordagens em nível de sistema para entender questões urgentes em metástase. O objetivo geral da MetNet é avançar nossa compreensão da metástase como um problema de corpo inteiro, em nível de sistema, para desenvolver uma imagem abrangente e coesa dos processos envolvidos. Através deste Anúncio de Oportunidade de Financiamento (FOA) , o NCI convida inscrições para Projetos de Pesquisa MetNet.Estes Projetos de Investigação devem ser definidos como entidades distintas que abordam o nível de sistemas para abordar lacunas e oportunidades na investigação de metástases para integração na MetNet e complementar a investigação em curso em toda a Rede.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute intends to support basic and translational research that will guide the development of a prophylactic or therapeutic Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) vaccine. A prophylactic KSHV vaccine could prevent primary KSHV infection, transmission, and subsequent development of KS and other KSHV-associated syndromes such as multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), or ameliorate the severity of disease. A therapeutic KSHV vaccine could be helpful in preventing or treating KSHV disease in people already infected with KSHV. The U01 research projects funded through this NOFO will form a cooperative group, the KSHV Vaccine Development Consortium (KVDC).

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs about future outcomes, including one’s response to cancer or cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social, psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members, caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from populations historically underrepresented or excluded from biomedical and behavioral research.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of applications that propose to advance research in cancer etiology and early detection biomarkers, utilizing the advantages of the unique biorepository resources of the NCI-sponsored Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. The PLCO Biorepository offers high-quality, prospectively collected, serial pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm participants, and a onetime collection of buccal cells from both the screened and the control arm participants. Available data associated with the biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking, screening results, and other clinical data. This FOA supports a wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to, biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported under this FOA.
Specific research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
Identifying biomarkers of various environmental, biochemical, and genetic risk factors of cancer;
Pivotal validation of early detection blood biomarkers in pre-diagnostic samples;
Developing early detection and/or risk prediction models based on longitudinal patterns of the biomarkers;
Identifying blood biomarkers that correlate with clinical behavior of the tumors, especially those that differentiate between aggressive and indolent cancers;
Correlating blood biomarkers to tissue biomarkers, histological and molecular subtypes, and clinical behaviors;
Biomarker discovery in pre-diagnostic samples using high through-put, proven technologies; and
Research on non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g., Alzheimer’s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis).

Through this funding opportunity announcement, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) solicits applications to “Cancer Epidemiology Cohorts: Building the Next Generation of Research Cohorts” PAR. This funding opportunity announcement seeks to support initiating and building the next generation of population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts to address specific knowledge gaps in cancer etiology and survivorship. Specifically, it will support methodological work necessary to initiate and build cancer epidemiology cohorts that can address critical scientific gaps concerning (i) new or unique exposures in relation to cancer risks and outcomes and (ii) achievement of diverse populations in cohorts with the inclusion of understudied populations (e.g., racial/ethnic groups, rural populations, individuals living in persistent poverty areas, and others) with substantial community engagement.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support studies that will identify, develop, and/or test strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, practices, programs, tools, treatments, guidelines, and policies. Studies that promote equitable dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions among underrepresented communities are encouraged. Conversely, there is a benefit in understanding circumstances that create a need to stop or reduce (“de-implement”) the use of practices that are ineffective, unproven, low-value, or harmful. In addition, studies to advance dissemination and implementation research methods and measures are encouraged. Applications that focus on re-implementation of evidence-based health services (e.g. cancer screening) that may have dropped off amidst the ongoing COVID pandemic are encouraged.
All applications must be within the scope of the mission of one of the Institutes/Centers listed above.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits grant applications proposing to utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, or other non-oncolytic viruses and their natural products to study the underlying mechanisms of the complex interactions between microorganisms, tumors, and the immune system, and to explore their clinical potential for cancer imaging, therapeutics or diagnostics. Projects can focus on using microorganisms as anti-tumor agents, as activators of anti-tumor immunity, or as delivery vehicles for treatment, diagnosis, or imaging, complementing or synergizing with existing tools and approaches. This FOA will support basic mechanistic and preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models. Applicants are encouraged to address both the microbial and tumor aspects of microbial tumor interactions relevant to microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), tumor imaging, tumor detection, or diagnosis.

The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support basic research that elucidates mechanisms by which the human microbiome inhibits or enhances anti-tumor immune responses, and to identify potential novel molecular targets for cancer prevention strategies.
Applications should be focused on delineating how host interactions with specific microbes (or consortia) or their metabolites target immune responses that enhance or prevent inflammation-associated or sporadic tumor formation. Concentration, timing, and duration of administered beneficial microbes may alter its effectiveness and thus those parameters should be rigorously addressed in the application.
Appropriate topics for this FOA include but are not limited to projects that:
Determine how Lactobacilli species inhibit colon cancer and if its anti-tumor activity requires the induction of T-cell-dependent IgAs;
Examine how commensal microbiota affect differentiation of naïve T cells to distinct Th17 subsets that may suppress or enhance tumor formation;
Evaluate the role of colonic Foxp3+RORγt+ Treg cells in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of commensal microbes to prevent colon cancer;
Determine how modulation of commensal H2S production affects host immunosurveillance;
Examine how SCFA production may affect anti-tumor immune functions of tumor associated macrophage;
Examine how microbial bile acid metabolism affects immune responses in liver and colon tumors.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) supports preclinical and early phase clinical research, as well as correlative studies, directly related to advancements in cancer treatment, diagnosis, prevention, comparative oncology, symptom management, or reduction of cancer disparities. This includes (but is not limited to) development and testing of the following: new molecular agents or biologics for cancer treatment; management strategies for cancer-related symptoms or treatment-related toxicity; cancer screening or diagnostic tools, such as imaging techniques; cancer preventive agents or approaches; predictive and prognostic biomarkers for patient selection or stratification; clinically relevant in vivo or in vitro tumor models (including genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenograft models, organoids, and cell lines); and strategies to address therapeutic outcome disparities among underserved populations. In addition to novel agents, new treatment strategies may involve repurposed agents or novel combinations of interventions (including radiation), based on established mechanisms of action. Comparative correlative studies in cancer patients with age, gender, racial/ethnic, or health disparities are encouraged to explore mechanisms underlying their differential responses (efficacy and toxicity) and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Comparative oncology studies in dogs investigating strategies for treatment and diagnosis of human disease are supported as well.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites U01 cooperative agreement applications for Physical Science-Oncology Projects (PS-OP). The goal of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network (PS-ON) is to foster the convergence of physical sciences approaches and perspectives with cancer research to advance our understanding of cancer biology and oncology by forming transdisciplinary teams of physical scientists and cancer biologists/physician scientists. Examples of physical scientists may include engineers, physicists, mathematicians, chemists, and computer scientists. The PS-OPs, individually and as a collaborative Network along with other PS-OPs and the Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OC), will support transdisciplinary research that: (1) establishes a physical sciences perspective within the cancer research community; (2) facilitates team science and field convergence at the intersection of physical sciences and cancer research; and (3) collectively tests physical sciences-based experimental and theoretical concepts of cancer and promotes innovative solutions to address outstanding questions in cancer research.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs about future outcomes, including one’s response to cancer or cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social, psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members, caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from populations historically underrepresented or excluded from biomedical and behavioral research.

                                                Both new and established investigators are encouraged to apply. As we don’t have a young investigator award, we encourage the next generation of exceptionally creative thinkers to submit their ideas with potential to produce breakthroughs.
All established investigators requesting pilot funds should show how their study is a departure from ongoing funded work.
New studies may be an extension of other work but cannot overlap any funded study unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that new funding will not duplicate existing support.
Rising Tide will require the return of all issued funds if found to be duplication of other funding sources. The intent of your proposed study should be to provide preliminary data for future support from other funding sources, thereby driving new and better treatment options to market.

The duration of the award is up to five years or less as specified in the grant award letter. Rising Tide will disburse awarded funds only if the recipient maintains strict compliance with reporting and participant accrual requirements as outlined in Rising Tide’s Research Funding Terms and Conditions.

                                                Rising Tide Foundation is a charitable, non-profit organization that promotes freedom to improve quality of life everywhere.
Rising Tide Clinical Cancer Research ’s funding program is to improve treatment options and quality of life for cancer patients by funding clinical studies focused on prevention, detection, treatments and survivorship. We are seeking to accelerate and support innovative and creative studies that have the high probability to change the paradigm for how cancer is treated today. The Rising Tide grant application is the vehicle by which proactive investigators may focus directly on their cancer patients’ clinical problems and treatments that may prove successful and have a high chance to be quickly implemented in daily practice. We are particularly interested in identifying and funding clinical investigators who: 
Have outstanding anti-cancer and supportive treatment ideas relevant to today’s cancer patients with a direct, meaningful therapeutic impact for enrolled patients. 
Are driven to deliver new and better treatment, symptom management, prevention and early detection options for their patients today through clinical trial studies directly relevant to Rising Tide’s Mission. 
Have collaborated to design novel, new, or pilot projects distinctly removed from currently funded research projects. 
Are in line with our patient centric approach and have a defined Patient Engagement plan throughout the the study. Priority will be given to research where patient engagement has happened very early at the research design and is clearly demonstrated in the application.

                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research.

                                                The Alzheimer's Association was founded in 1980 by a small group of family members caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. These individuals united in disappointment with the quality of information available to them and in dissatisfaction with the lack of medical and social awareness of this devastating condition. Two years after its founding, the fledgling organization funded its first research grant, awarding a total of about $80,000 to a handful of investigators. Since then, the Association has grown into the largest nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. Today, the Alzheimer's Association leads the way to end Alzheimer's and all other dementia by accelerating global research, driving risk reduction and early detection, and maximizing quality care and support.
The APOE Biology in Alzheimer's (ABA) Grant Program solicits projects that aim to address some of the key challenges in Alzheimer's research today as related to APOE contributions and biology, including but not limited to:
Cause(s) of the Disease;
Experimental Models of Disease;
Early and Accurate Detection and Diagnosis;
Treatment;
Tool development.

The Alzheimer's Association mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.
The areas of research that the clinician scientist proposes for funding are not limited to patient-oriented, human subject research, but may also include translational research specifically designed to develop treatments or enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. These translational areas of research include epidemiologic or behavioral studies, clinical trials, studies of disease mechanisms, mapping disease features or spread the development of new technologies, and health services and outcomes research. Disease related basic science studies not directly involving humans or human tissue are also encouraged if the primary goal is the development of therapies, diagnostic tests, or other tools to prevent or mitigate neurological diseases.

                                                The Alzheimer's Association is the leading, global voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care and support, and the largest private, nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.
The AARG-NTF grant program aims to fund investigators who are new to Alzheimer's and all other dementia fields of research, including neuroscience or neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lewy body dementia, etc.), and provide them with funding to establish a research path in Alzheimer's and all other dementias, to develop preliminary or pilot data, to test procedures and to develop hypotheses. The intent is to support research that will lay the groundwork for future research grant applications to federal or other funding entities, like the National Institutes of Health, including future proposals to the Alzheimer's Association.

                                                The Alzheimer's Association is the leading, global voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care and support, and the largest private, nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.
The AARG-D grant program aims to fund early-career investigators who are less than 18 years past their doctoral degree or post-residency (M.D. or D.O.) with funding that will allow them to develop preliminary or pilot data, to test procedures and to develop hypotheses. The intent is to support early-career development that will lay the groundwork for future research grant applications to federal or other funding entities.
The objective of this award is to increase the number of highly trained investigators from diverse backgrounds whose basic, clinical and social/behavioral research interests are grounded in the advanced methods and experimental approaches needed to solve problems related to Alzheimer's and all other dementias in general and in health disparities populations.

                                                Founded in 1998 by co-chairmen Leonard A. and Ronald S. Lauder, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) aims to rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.
The Drug Development RFP supports investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies (or the international equivalent) and early-phase clinical trials that test promising pharmacological interventions and devices for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Both disease-modifying and symptomatic agents will be considered.
This funding opportunity prioritizes diverse drug mechanisms and modes of action related to the biology of aging and other emerging therapeutic areas for dementia. For this reason, amyloid targeted approaches and cholinesterase inhibitor proposals will not be considered for this RFP.

The aim of this RFP is to further develop and validate established biomarkers for which there is a clear clinical need in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This RFP prioritizes biomarkers with a defined context of use, a clear advantage over other relevant biomarkers, and a path to commercialization and/or clinical use.
Specifically, this RFP focuses on:
Developing novel PET ligands for clinical trials;
Supporting novel CSF biomarkers;
Validating innovative MRI approaches in larger cohorts;
Developing novel measures of functional activity such as EEG.

                                                Founded in 1998 by co-chairmen Leonard A. and Ronald S. Lauder, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) aims to rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.
The ADDF seeks to support studies of cognitive symptoms due to health conditions, comparative effectiveness research, and epidemiological studies that probe whether the use or choice of drugs alters the risk for dementia or cognitive decline.
The Prevention RFP supports:
Studies of Cognitive Decline and Risk Reduction
Comparative Effectiveness Research
Studies Leveraging the Consortium of Cohorts for Alzheimer's Prevention Action (CAPA)

These areas of research include epidemiologic or behavioral studies, clinical trials, studies of disease mechanisms, the development of new technologies, and health services and outcomes research.” Disease-related studies not directly involving humans or human tissue are also encouraged if the primary goal is the development of therapies, diagnostic tests, or other tools to prevent or mitigate neurological diseases.
Recipient must be an AAN member interested in an academic career in neurological research who has completed residency or a PhD no more than 5 years prior to the beginning of this award (July 1, 2024). If you have completed both residency and a PhD, your eligibility is based on when you completed residency. If you completed a fellowship of any kind after residency, your eligibility is still based on the date you finished residency.
Applicants at accredited US and international institutions are eligible.

Unrestricted grants support early-stage investigators conducting research that advances the knowledge and understanding of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine. A primary goal of the ATS Research Program is to enable early-stage investigators to transition to independent research careers.
The Research Program encourages applications in basic, patient-oriented, and public health topics. In the area of public health, the Research Program is particularly interested in funding projects that will inform health policy decisions. These include projects that explore the quality and safety of a specific treatment and compare the effectiveness of different therapies.

                                                Throughout its history, BioMarin has worked tirelessly to make a difference by pursuing bold science. Our first approved therapy was inspired by a father who refused to accept that his son’s rare diagnosis lacked a viable therapy. That relentless pursuit to change the course of his son’s future through the power of treatment is at the core of who BioMarin is today.

                                                The Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use is implemented though its partner organizations: Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Vital Strategies, and the World Health Organization.
A global initiative to reduce tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries was launched in 2006 with funds from Michael R. Bloomberg. A competitively awarded grants program is an important part of the Initiative. The grants program supports projects to develop and deliver high-impact evidence-based tobacco control interventions.

                                                The BrightFocus Foundation is a nonprofit organization that supports research and provides public education on brain and eye diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, macular degeneration and glaucoma.
BrightFocus Foundation, throught the National Glaucoma Research Grants, provides research funds for U.S. and international researchers pursuing pioneering research leading to greater understanding, prevention, and treatment of glaucoma. Preference is made for exciting pilot projects that would not, at their present stage, be competitive for large government or industry awards.
The NGR program offers two types of awards:
Standard Awards:
The standard award provides significant funding for researchers who have already generated some amount of preliminary data, but are often required to demonstrate additional, significant progress before they can apply to governmental or industrial funding agencies.
Postdoctoral Fellowship Awards:
Postdoctoral fellowship awards are intended for young researchers in their final stages of mentored training. These awards fund projects in an established laboratory that will serve as the basis for the applicant's own independent research career.

                                                Rift Valley Fever:
Vaccine candidate is based on any platform which is not a live-attenuated platform.
Vaccine candidate is intended for use in humans (CEPI will not support development of exclusively veterinary RVF vaccines). 
While CEPI is open to candidates from applicants/developers globally, preference will be given to proposals from groups based in RVF-endemic regions (i.e., Africa and the Middle East), or with plans to conduct clinical evaluation of candidates in endemic areas.
 Pan-Sarbecovirus or other coronaviruses:
Vaccine candidate has preclinical proof-of-concept data, including evidence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and efficacy in a suitable animal challenge model (e.g., hamster) against Sarbecoviruses known to infect humans. This data must be shown in the application.
The applicant has advanced a SARS-CoV-2 candidate produced in the same platform into clinical development.
Lassa Fever:
Vaccine candidate has demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept, i.e., evidence of induction of antibody and T-cell responses. 
While CEPI is open to candidates from applicants/developers globally, preference will be given to proposals from groups based in Lassa Fever endemic regions in West Africa, or with plans to conduct clinical evaluation of candidates in these endemic areas. 
Nipah:
Vaccine candidate has demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept, i.e., immunogenicity and, ideally, efficacy in an animal challenge model against one of the common Nipah strains.
While CEPI is open to candidates from applicants/developers globally, preference will be given to proposals with plans to conduct clinical evaluation of candidates in Nipah affected countries. 
Global South developers are particularly encouraged to apply.

                                                CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We're working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, which caused significant morbidity, mortality, and disruption of normal life around the world, CEPI has set out a 100-Days Mission to make vaccines and other biologic countermeasures available more rapidly in response to an outbreak of a new pathogen, referred to as Disease X. The aim is to have vaccines ready for initial authorisation and manufacturing at scale within 100 days of recognition of a pandemic pathogen, when justified by the severity of the situation. Coupled with improved surveillance, and swift use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, a vaccine or other biologic countermeasure developed in 100 days could defuse the threat of a new pathogen with pandemic potential.
The objective for Focus Area 2 is to advance new candidates for CEPI priority pathogens and viral families, aligned with CEPI’s strategic objectives to accelerate development of vaccines against known high-risk pathogens and to build a library of vaccine prototypes from high-risk viral families to give a head-start on novel threats (Disease X).
The scope of Focus Area 2 will be amended periodically in response to evolving portfolio priorities and needs.

                                                CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We're working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, which caused significant morbidity, mortality, and disruption of normal life around the world, CEPI has set out a 100-Days Mission to make vaccines and other biologic countermeasures available more rapidly in response to an outbreak of a new pathogen, referred to as Disease X. The aim is to have vaccines ready for initial authorisation and manufacturing at scale within 100 days of recognition of a pandemic pathogen, when justified by the severity of the situation. Coupled with improved surveillance, and swift use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, a vaccine or other biologic countermeasure developed in 100 days could defuse the threat of a new pathogen with pandemic potential.
The objective of Focus Area 1 is to advance vaccine platforms that can transform outbreak response to Disease X, addressing needs for speed, safety/efficacy, and access. Through proposals awarded under this Focus Area, CEPI aims to build significant preclinical, CMC, clinical, and regulatory expertise with vaccine platforms that could be leveraged for rapid adoption in an outbreak and made accessible to all populations that need them.
Eligible Viruses for Focus Area 1:
SARS-CoV-2;
RSV;
Rabies;
Yellow Fever;
Chikungunya;
Japanese Encephalitis;
Hepatitis B;
Influenza;
Measles;
Other virus - with CEPI consent.

Component II awards are considered for more advanced programs that generally have identified a clinical candidate and are moving into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies such as PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and Phase 1/2 clinical trials in CF patients. Component II awards are typically supported at a level of up to $3 million-$5 million for two or more years and require substantial matching funds. Only direct costs are covered.

                                                The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), a nonprofit donor-supported organization, aims to assure the development of the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF) and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
The Path to a Cure: Industry Award Program aims to support development of treatments for the underlying cause of the disease and, ultimately, a cure for every person with CF. Awards may be made for either discovery, platform development for gene delivery and editing strategies, and preclinical and/or clinical development activities that support development of treatments that address the underlying cause of CF.
Industry programs supported through the Path to a Cure will focus on two core strategies to address the underlying cause of CF:
Restoring CFTR protein when none exists, including that from nonsense mutations;
Fixing or replacing the underlying genetic mutation to address the root cause of CF through gene replacement/transfer, gene editing approaches, or stem cell therapy.

Funding through the John Hansen Research Grant is dependent on the eligibility of the applicant: Applicant must have received a doctoral degree (PhD, MD, or equivalent achievements) in a field pertinent to the grant within the last 10 years from the grant call start date. Applicants whose careers have been interrupted after receiving a doctoral degree, may request an extension of the degree requirement insofar as the interruption occurred for example to one of the following reasons: family care responsibilities, applicant’s disability or illness, active duty community service. Such request for extension shall be initiated within the scope of the application phase by completing the Extension Request Form which will be provided on demand (grant@dkms.org). Upon request, the reasons leading to such a request must be substantiated by appropriate documentation. The requirement for extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Applicants must appoint a supervisor in his/her/its application. The supervisor should ideally be a senior scientist in the applicant’s host institution with experience in the research proposal topic, who can provide guidance and support for an adequate project progress.

• € 1,800,000 will be available for two large proposals, which should be for 2 to 4 years with a maximum budget of € 900,000 per proposal.
• Based on experience in previous calls, we envisage scope for smaller grants that would aim to address research questions that require relatively lesser funding. Therefore, an additional € 900,000 will be made available for three smaller proposals, which should be for 2 to 4 years with a maximum budget of € 300,000 per proposal.

                                                Dioraphte, a private charitable Foundation established in the Netherlands, aims to support new initiatives behind the scenes, and to financially nurture projects that would otherwise be difficult to get off the ground. 
The Research Programme for Skin-related Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) aims to support translational and clinical experimental research that underpins the understanding of pathophysiology and pathogenesis of Skin-related NTDs. 
The Foundation will give priority to five areas: 
Immunology, pathophysiology, pathogenesis, or metabolic processes during infection that could lead to improved drugs, treatments, diagnostics or vaccines;
Improved experimental or population models of skin infection to support research into improved drugs, treatments, diagnostics or vaccines;
Innovative approaches to the discovery and development of drugs, diagnostics or vaccines;
Underlying pathology in diverse endemic populations that determines variation in response to diagnostics, drugs or vaccines;
Role of skin commensals and co-infections in disease.

                                                The Foundation Fighting Blindness (FFB) aims to drive research providing preventions, treatments and cures for people affected by blinding retinal diseases.
The Foundation will make awards for meritorious research proposals that advance our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of PRPH2 in the retina. To address gaps in knowledge, proposals that focus on the following topics are strongly encouraged:
Fundamental PRPH2 biology and biochemistry
Development of high throughput and/or saturation assays to determine the functional consequences of PRPH2 variants on protein structure and/or function and to assign pathogenicity.
Creation and characterization of precise, accurate animal models,
Studies demonstrating proof-of-concept for therapeutic approaches, particularly mutation-agnostic approaches.
Improved understanding of disease heterogeneity, through understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships or identification of genetic and/or environmental modifiers

                                                The Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (FSFW) is an independent, nonprofit organization committed to reducing deaths and diseases caused by smoking. Its mission is to end smoking in this generation. To achieve this goal on a truly global scale, FSFW strives to identify and address the unique needs of the developing world as they relate to tobacco cessation and harm reduction.
The objective of unsolicited proposals is to acquaint the Foundation with novel and nonduplicative projects and research opportunities and to stimulate the Foundation’s interest in these areas. The Foundation will consider, and potentially fund, grant proposals from professional experts in a variety of fields that can support the mission to end smoking in this generation. Such proposals might include innovative research, scientific, or economic projects that fill critical knowledge gaps. Applicants are advised to review awarded grants to understand selected areas of interest. However, applicants are free to submit proposals on a variety of topics that are consistent with the Foundation’s mission.

                                                The Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance (Fara) is a national, public, non-profit, tax-exempt organization dedicated to curing Friedrech’s Ataxia (FA) through research. Fara grants and activities provide support for basic and translational Fa research, pharmaceutical/biotech drug development, clinical trials, and scientific conferences.
The Kyle Bryant Translational Research Award honors its namesake for his diligent efforts to aid in the acceleration of preclinical studies to early pilot trials in Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) patients. This award is given to proposals focused on pre-clinical and clinical investigations that will advance treatments for FA.
The specific aims must target one or more of the following:
Identification of biomarkers for FA that will elucidate disease variability, severity, and prognosis; facilitate drug screening, and/or optimize selection of patients and clinical endpoints for clinical trials;
Development of tools and technologies that can: be directly used for therapy development, overcome existing obstacles to treatment and be directly applied to, or adapted for, delivery of potential therapeutics;
Pre-clinical development and testing of potential therapeutics, biologics, and devices in cells and animals;
Clinical studies of patient outcome measures.

FARA encourages applications from junior investigators and young clinicians. Reviewers consider the investigator's career stage and will review the grant application with this information in mind. For Postdoctoral Fellowships and Postdoctoral Research Awards FARA requires junior investigators to submit a personal statement describing their current position and plans for the future as it relates to FA research, with a description of career goals and how the proposed research and research environment will favor achieving those goals. A mentoring plan developed jointly by the junior investigator and mentor(s), as well as letters of support from all mentors are also required.
FARA will accept grant submissions from industry partners who have a demonstrated participation in the FA research community and are advancing therapeutic candidates for FA.

                                                The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) is a collaborative network for clinical research, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. It's mission is to accelerate the clinical development of immune tolerance therapies.
The ITN, through its Call for Concept Proposals, accepts proposals for clinical trials and tolerance assays applied to transplantation, autoimmune diseases, (including but not limited to) type 1 diabetes, and asthma & allergic diseases. Concept Proposals for clinical trials should represent novel therapies which have a strong biological basis for inducing tolerance (requisite preclinical investigation must be complete, with encouraging results). Concept Proposals for clinical trials should include plans for integrated mechanistic studies of biomarkers of disease activity and tolerance assessment.

Grants are normally only awarded to applicants who are affiliated with an academic institution. The ITI Foundation offers two types of grants:
Small grant (SG): This grant type is primarily intended for young researchers who have been working within established groups and wish to expand their scope and level of responsibility or want to establish a track record in implant dentistry;
Large Grant (LG): This grant type will be awarded to experienced researchers/research groups only.

                                                Researchers:
Researchers from any scientific discipline worldwide are eligible for funding.
Typically, the researchers we fund hold advanced degrees (MD, PhD or the equivalent) and academic positions at universities, medical centers or research institutions.
Innovator Awards may only have one Principal Investigator, and funding is awarded to their home institution. Additional investigators may be included as Co-Investigators, and the lead institution can create subawards.
Postdocs are not eligible to apply as a Principal Investigator.
Researchers may submit multiple proposals, as long as there are distinct aims and objectives for each proposal.
Institutions:
All nonprofit institutions must be classified as “not a private foundation” under Section 509(a)(3).
If a proposal from a nonprofit institution outside of the United States is ultimately recommended for funding, the institution will be required to undergo an Equivalency Determination process. 
For-profit institutions must demonstrate that their proposed project furthers the Foundation’s charitable mission of advancing biomedical research.
The Foundation may upon occasion make grants to government and public agencies, as well as to independent projects that have a qualified tax-exempt fiscal sponsor.

                                                The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today.
The Parkinson’s Disease Therapeutics Pipeline Program advances pre-clinical and clinical development of interventions by prioritizing scientifically robust studies that will accelerate progress towards the clinic and ultimately into patients’ hands. Our strategic funding focuses on programs addressing unmet needs of people with PD with clear potential to prevent, stop, or delay disease progression or to reduce the burden of daily symptoms. As the requirements for delivering new treatments into the market depend on specialized expertise and resources, a unique goal of this program is to promote clearer paths to commercialization and market access by the PD communit.
When considering applications submitted to this program, MJFF prioritizes pre-clinical and clinical programs that may reduce, slow or prevent disabling motor or non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s not well managed by current treatments. Activities within scope of this program include:
Pre-Clinical: Identifying, validating and/or developing novel pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions through pre-clinical development from early screening to pre-clinical characterization and testing.
Clinical: Progressing promising interventions with strong preclinical packages into/through initial clinical assessment exploring pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, safety/tolerability, or early proof of clinical efficacy.

                                                The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today.
The Edmond J. Safra Fellowship in Movement Disorders aims to grow the global base of movement disorder specialists — neurologists with additional training in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders — by training movement disorder clinician-researchers who can provide expert care and lead scientific advances.
As the demand for movement disorder specialists increases, not enough neurologists are receiving vital training in Parkinson’s and related conditions. To address this need, The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF), in collaboration with longtime partner the Edmond J. Safra Foundation, launched the Edmond J. Safra Fellowship in Movement Disorders. The program annually funds eight academic centers to each train a new movement disorder clinician-researcher over a two-year period and is growing an international, collaborative network of next-generation leaders in Parkinson’s research and care.

                                                The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), a  nonprofit organization, drives discoveries for new treatments, accelerates groundbreaking clinical trials and fuels the most robust data-driven initiatives in cancer research. Its goal is to find a cure for each and every patient diagnosed with multiple myeloma.
The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is pleased to announce a new Clinical Translational Research Program, the MMRF Myeloma Omics Initiative. This initiative will provide successful applicants access to state-of-the-art -omics platforms and analytical resources to analyze bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from patients enrolled in high value clinical studies in multiple myeloma and precursor conditions.
The MMRF is seeking applications from investigators or research teams that have biological samples that might address any of these critical questions:
From the initiation and evolution of malignant plasma cells through disease progression;
Tumor intrinsic molecular events that drive clinical response and relapse or resistance;
Host intrinsic biological processes that monitor and control malignant disease and the biological events that lead to the loss or dysregulation of disease control processes;
Impact of therapeutic intervention on tumor- and host-intrinsic processes and how alterations in these processes influence clinical response and relapse or resistance.

                                                The National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) funds research to find a cure or acceptable treatment for alopecia areata, supports those with the disease, and educates the public about alopecia areata.
The Pediatric Alopecia Areata Challenge Grant is intended to stimulate scientists to establish or sustain research programs focused on pediatric alopecia areata. Investigators with any innovative research idea are encouraged to apply for the challenge grant, with priority consideration given to proposals that address one or more of the following areas of interest:
Investigations of targets or pathways that will advance understanding of the pathophysiology of pediatric AA;
Investigations of epidemiology or the natural history of pediatric AA;
Elucidation of the burden of pediatric alopecia areata on patients and families including the psychosocial impact;
Advances in treatment or tools for treatment decision-making by patients and families.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites applications proposing innovative strategies to target and manipulate brain cell subtypes that are altered in aging, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and AD-Related Dementias (ADRDs). ADRDs include frontotemporal disorders (FTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), and multiple etiology dementias (MED). 
Specifically, the goal of this NOFO is to encourage the development and utilization of sophisticated tools that pair breakthroughs in adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid engineering with enhancer element identification to do the following:
Optimize precise targeting of disease-relevant cell subtypes in aged and degenerating mammalian brains. 
Monitor and/or manipulate these cells in vivo to address mechanistic hypotheses related to brain aging and AD/ADRD in animal models.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) invites applications from neuroscience investigators seeking support to advance their small molecule drug discovery and development projects into the clinic. Participants in the BPN are responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools and receive funding for all activities to be conducted in their own laboratories. In addition, applicants will collaborate with NIH-funded consultants and can augment their project with NIH contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis including under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Phase I clinical testing. Projects can enter either at the Discovery or the Development stage.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages research on the biology of high confidence risk factors associated with complex brain disorders, with a focus on the intracellular, transcellular and circuit substrates of neural function.
For the purposes of this NOFO , the term “complex” can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder.
Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ, or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to “model” disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components and processes.
The resulting paradigms, component pathways and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification.
The present NOFO (R21 activity code) can be used for applications to develop early stage, high-risk, exploratory approaches or establish proof-of-concept where there is little or no preliminary data. Applicants proposing to develop lines of inquiry where feasibility or proof of concept has been established should apply to the companion R01 NOFO (PAR-24-024).

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) is to support investigators who have interest and capability to join efforts for the discovery of in vivo chemical probes for novel brain targets. It is expected that applicants will have, in hand, the starting compounds ( validated hits ) for chemical optimization and bioassays for testing new analog compounds.
Through this NOFO, NIH wishes to stimulate research in
Discovery and development of novel, small molecules for their potential use in understanding biological processes relevant to the missions of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Eye Institute (NEI), and/or National Institute on Aging (NIA) and
Discovery and/or validation of novel, biological targets that will inform studies of brain disease mechanisms. Emphasis will be placed on projects that provide new insight into important disease-related biological targets and biological processes.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages research grant applications directed toward developing next-generation human cell-derived microphysiological systems (MPS) and related assays that replicate complex nervous system architectures and physiology with improved fidelity over current capabilities. Supported projects will be expected to enable future studies of complex nervous system development, function, and aging in healthy and disease states.
This FOA is intended to encourage the further development of projects with feasibility support for the line of investigation. Applicants proposing exploratory research at the early and conceptual stages of project development may instead wish to apply to the companion R21 FOA.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to invite applications from research institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to provide senior administrators from these institutions with advanced training in the management of NIH grants. The goal is to improve oversight of NIAID grant awards and compliance with NIH funding policies and Federal research funding requirements for NIAID-supported foreign institutions in LMICs.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goals of this NOFO is to support locally relevant research in critical areas of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at Low- and Middle-Income Country (LMIC) Institutions, to enhance research capacity, and to build a network of researchers both within and across LMICs to address this critical burden. This initiative is expected to stimulate new research on the interplay between HIV and development of NCDs in persons living with HIV (PLWH). This includes exploratory studies to uncover the extent to which HIV infection influences the etiopathogenesis of the NCDs; and to identify and develop appropriate approaches for effective diagnosis, prevention, therapeutic interventions and integrated clinical care for PLWH with the comorbid conditions. Applicants should develop their studies in keeping with the NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goals of this NOFO is to support locally relevant research in critical areas of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at Low- and Middle-Income Country (LMIC) Institutions, to enhance research capacity, and to build a network of researchers both within and across LMICs to address this critical burden. This initiative is expected to stimulate new research on the interplay between HIV and development of NCDs in persons living with HIV (PLWH). This includes exploratory studies to uncover the extent to which HIV infection influences the etiopathogenesis of the NCDs; and to identify and develop appropriate approaches for effective diagnosis, prevention, therapeutic interventions and integrated clinical care for PLWH with the comorbid conditions. Applicants should develop their studies in keeping with the NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support the development of state-of-the-art projects that integrate imaging, biomarkers, digital pathomics, glycomics, metabolomics, other omic information and/or meta data obtained from platforms including but not limited to lower resolution diagnostic acquisitions and systemic biomarker results to high resolution single-cell analytics / imaging applied to the characterization of heterogeneous cell populations within tumor for improving current approaches for: (1) the early detection of organ confined premetastatic aggressive cancer, and, (2) identifying precancerous lesions associated with the development of a subsequent lethal phenotype. This FOA specifically attempts to address and improve diagnostic uncertainty in clinical decisions by improving detection sensitivity and specificity of integrated multiparametric platforms. For example, N-dimensional co-registered, cross-correlated imaging data integrated with multiplexed biomarker results and/or digital pathomics, glycomics, or metabolomic imaging using analytic strategies such as artificial intelligence or virtual reality visualization techniques. The projects supported by this FOA will collectively participate in the existing Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB) Research Program. The goals of the CIB are to: (1) improve diagnostic performance by developing methodology for the early identification of potentially lethal cancer versus non-lethal disease, (2) minimize/better manage overdiagnosis and (3) reduce false positives and false negatives.
This FOA will utilize the NIH Research Project Grant (R01) mechanism and is suitable for projects where proof-of-principle of the individual proposed methodologies have already been established and supportive preliminary data are available.

Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends  to support the rigorous assessment of barriers to quality cancer treatment and follow-up care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) cancer survivors. This funding opportunity is intended to address a critical need for improved care delivery and outcomes for SGM cancer survivors. The goal is to address the disease burden in an underserved and understudied population that is at higher risk of poorer health outcomes. The NCI solicits proposals for observational and/or interventional studies of SGM survivors designed to understand barriers and/or improve care and outcomes for SGM people with cancer, using interoperable sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection in cancer care settings, where appropriate.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for investigator-initiated studies addressing mechanisms by which incretin mimetics, specifically glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 or dual GLP-1/ glucose dependent insulinotropic polypepide (GIP)-1 receptor agonists (RAs), impact cancer risk.  The focus on these agents is due to their reported effects on thyroid, prostate and other cancer risks, and the generally more favorable efficacy and side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics. In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the cancer biology field who may study incretin mimetic effects on diseases other than cancer. Investigators wishing to study incretin mimetics other than GLP-1 RAs or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, must justify why the agent(s) they propose to study are more effective and/or have a more favorable side effect profile than GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP-1 RAs. Route of agent administration (oral vs. other) is, by itself, not an adequate justification.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this funding opportunity (R01/R21) is to encourage multidisciplinary investigators to develop new approaches or apply existing approaches in novel ways to measure brain activity, connectivity, genomics, or other aspects across the age spectrum of neurodevelopment. The overarching goal is to extend our understanding of brain development and aging, including studies of the neurodevelopmental origins of later health and disease.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this NOFO is to announce support for meritorious research projects that address research questions relevant to human dental, oral, or craniofacial (DOC) biology, and diseases and conditions, through analysis of existing and publicly available genomic data, with or without other types of complementary data, using statistical and computational approaches. Data analysis for each project can be performed using existing and/or novel methods to be developed in the proposed  project(s), including methods for data and metadata mining, data integration, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) methods. In addition to analysis of existing data, experimental or in silico work is required to validate the results of the proposed analysis, or to validate a newly developed analytic method. Projects aimed at understanding oral health disparities to inform strategies for improving health for all individuals are a priority. Projects focused on investigating and/or characterizing human biological pathways to inform identification of intervention targets or defining the pathogenicity of known genetic variants are encouraged.

The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to invite applications that bundle independent protocols for phase 1 clinical trials with phase 1b/phase 2a clinical trials to streamline the early-stage evaluation of promising pharmacological interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Candidate interventions evaluated through this program, which can include small molecules or biologics for example, must engage non-amyloid/non-tau mechanisms and aim to address cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals across the spectrum, from pre-symptomatic to more severe stages of disease. This NOFO uses a phased award activity code. Applications must include prespecified, go/no-go safety and tolerability milestones that must be met to advance from phase 1 to latter stages of clinical development.

This Small Research Grant (R03) program will support meritorious projects to provide needed scientific insight to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and/or care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). Specifically, this NOFO will support projects covering a wide range of topics related to AD/ADRD. The overall goal of this NOFO is (i) to encourage the next generation of researchers to pursue research and academic careers in AD/ADRD research; and (ii) to stimulate established researchers who have not had a major award in AD/ADRD research to perform pilot studies to develop new, innovative AD/ADRD research programs that leverage and build upon their existing expertise. Individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups are always encouraged to apply for NIH support. Investigators who have not successfully competed for an award under this or prior versions of this announcement are specifically encouraged to apply.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goal of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO R01) is to encourage research to explore mechanisms of inflammasome activation and their link to neurocognitive disorder (NCD) and immune function in people with HIV and substance use disorders (SUDs). This NOFO supports studies to (1) elucidate the role and the underlying mechanisms of inflammasomes in virus and drug-induced immune activation, (2) identify molecular markers associated with inflammasome pathways in NCD and 3) illuminate the cellular and tissue microenvironments that influence inflammasomes in HIV-1 infection or disease progression among individuals with SUD. Overall goal of this program is to facilitate translation of inflammasome research findings into therapeutic tools that improve clinical outcomes in people with HIV.

Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute intends to support basic and translational research that will guide the development of a prophylactic or therapeutic Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) vaccine. A prophylactic KSHV vaccine could prevent primary KSHV infection, transmission, and subsequent development of KS and other KSHV-associated syndromes such as multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), or ameliorate the severity of disease. A therapeutic KSHV vaccine could be helpful in preventing or treating KSHV disease in people already infected with KSHV. The U01 research projects funded through this NOFO will form a cooperative group, the KSHV Vaccine Development Consortium (KVDC).

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) supports preclinical and early phase clinical research, as well as correlative studies, directly related to advancements in cancer treatment, diagnosis, prevention, comparative oncology, symptom management, or reduction of cancer disparities. This includes (but is not limited to) development and testing of the following: new molecular agents or biologics for cancer treatment; management strategies for cancer-related symptoms or treatment-related toxicity; cancer screening or diagnostic tools, such as imaging techniques; cancer preventive agents or approaches; predictive and prognostic biomarkers for patient selection or stratification; clinically relevant in vivo or in vitro tumor models (including genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenograft models, organoids, and cell lines); and strategies to address therapeutic outcome disparities among underserved populations. In addition to novel agents, new treatment strategies may involve repurposed agents or novel combinations of interventions (including radiation), based on established mechanisms of action. Comparative correlative studies in cancer patients with age, gender, racial/ethnic, or health disparities are encouraged to explore mechanisms underlying their differential responses (efficacy and toxicity) and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Comparative oncology studies in dogs investigating strategies for treatment and diagnosis of human disease are supported as well.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage applications for studies that will enhance knowledge of mechanisms associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). The findings are expected to advance mechanistic understanding of both biobehavioral and neurobiological pathways leading to NPS. Findings may also provide insight into novel therapeutic targets that can be advanced into interventions to treat and prevent the development of NPS in AD and/or ADRD.
This NOFO uses the R21 mechanism, while the companion PAR-23-207 uses the R01 grant mechanism. Investigators proposing high risk/high reward projects that lack preliminary data may be more appropriate for the R21 mechanism, while applicants with preliminary data who seek longer-term funding should apply using the R01 mechanism.

                                                The National Ataxia Foundation (NAF) is a membership supported nonprofit organization established in 1957 to help persons with Ataxia and their families. NAF is the only organization in the United States dedicated to the disease that serves all types of Ataxia. The NAF is dedicated to improving the lives of persons affected by Ataxia through support, education, and research.
NAF Research Seed Money Grants are awarded to new and innovative studies that are relevant to the cause, pathogenesis or treatment of hereditary or sporadic ataxias. Research grants are offered primarily as “seed monies” to assist investigators in the early or pilot phase of their studies and as additional support for ongoing investigations on demonstration of need. It is hoped that these studies will be further developed to attract future funding from other sources. Grants are awarded for one year only.

                                                The Scleroderma Foundation (SF) is the national organization for people with scleroderma and their families and friends. The Foundation is also a leading nonprofit supporter of scleroderma research. The Scleroderma Foundation is interested in fostering development of innovative and high quality research by new and established investigators in fields related to systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma).
The SF through the Established Investigator Grant Program seeks applications from promising established investigators both inside and outside the field of scleroderma research who wish to propose pilot studies to obtain preliminary data dealing with a highly innovative and/or highly relevant theme related to the disease. The Grant will support pilot research that is likely to lead to more substantial unlimited research project grants from federal or non-federal sources.

                                                The Thrasher Research Fund aims to provide grants for clinical, hypothesis-driven research that offers substantial promise for meaningful advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases, particularly research that offers broad-based applications.
The E.W. "Al" Thrasher Awards aim to improve children's health through medical research, with an emphasis on projects that have the potential to translate into clinically meaningful results within a few years. Ideal applications for the Award address significant health problems, offering the potential for practical solutions to these problems. Such solutions should be innovative and have the potential for broad applicability with low barriers to implementation.

                                                The Thrasher Research Fund aims to provide grants for clinical, hypothesis-driven research that offers substantial promise for meaningful advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases, particularly research that offers broad-based applications.
The Early Career Awards recognizes that young investigators may find it difficult to remain in pediatric research because of a lack of funding. Therefore, the purpose of this program is to encourage the development of medical research in child health by awarding small grants to new researchers, helping them gain a foothold in this important area. The goal is to fund applicants who will go on to be independent investigators. The Fund will make up to 30 awards total with two funding cycles (15 awards each).

                                                The Vasculitis Foundation (VF) is the only international organization for patients with vasculitis. Founded in 1986, VF provides patients and family members with practical information and coping strategies to live successfully with vasculitis. The VF supports and empowers patients through education, awareness and research.
The Vasculitis Foundation, a leading international supporter of research on vasculitis, is pleased to announce requests for applications for our 2024 research funding cycle through our Young Investigator Award. The Young Investigator Award provides grants to assist investigators in the early or pilot phase of a study or as additional support for a promising ongoing investigation.  It is hoped that these studies will be further developed to attract future funding from other sources.
The VF Research Program provides one or two-year seed grants to support pilot studies in researching:
Etiology/Pathogenesis (could include a broad range of studies of immunity, inflammation, or vascular biology.  (Relevance to human vasculitis will be taken into account by the reviewers.)
Epidemiology, including genetics
Diagnosis, including identification of disease subtypes
Treatment/Management, including therapeutics to treat vasculitis or prevent complications, biomarkers, and psychosocial outcomes
Goals: To improve the quality of life for patients with vasculitis, and ultimately find the cause/s and cure for vasculitis.

                                                The World Diabetes Foundation (WDF) is an independent, non-profit foundation based in Bagsværd, Denmark, that aims to alleviate human suffering related to diabetes and its complications among those least able to withstand the burden of the disease.
WDF funds projects devoted to improving diabetes care and prevention in low- and middle-income countries included in the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of ODA Recipients.
Project proposals need to be formulated and owned locally. Projects should provide focused, replicable and sustainable solutions with the potential to prevent diabetes and improve the lives of people with the disease.

Applicants whose careers have been interrupted after receiving a doctoral degree, may request an extension of the degree requirement insofar as the interruption occurred for example to one of the following reasons: family care responsibilities, applicant’s disability or illness, active duty community service. Such request for extension shall be initiated within the scope of the application phase by completing the Extension Request Form which will be provided on demand (grant@dkms.org). Upon request, the reasons leading to such a request must be substantiated by appropriate documentation. The requirement for extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Applicants must appoint a supervisor in his/her/its application. The supervisor should ideally be a senior scientist in the applicant’s host institution with experience in the research proposal topic, who can provide guidance and support for an adequate project progress.

• € 1,800,000 will be available for two large proposals, which should be for 2 to 4 years with a maximum budget of € 900,000 per proposal.
• Based on experience in previous calls, we envisage scope for smaller grants that would aim to address research questions that require relatively lesser funding. Therefore, an additional € 900,000 will be made available for three smaller proposals, which should be for 2 to 4 years with a maximum budget of € 300,000 per proposal.

                                                Dioraphte, a private charitable Foundation established in the Netherlands, aims to support new initiatives behind the scenes, and to financially nurture projects that would otherwise be difficult to get off the ground. 
The Research Programme for Skin-related Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) aims to support translational and clinical experimental research that underpins the understanding of pathophysiology and pathogenesis of Skin-related NTDs. 
The Foundation will give priority to five areas: 
Immunology, pathophysiology, pathogenesis, or metabolic processes during infection that could lead to improved drugs, treatments, diagnostics or vaccines;
Improved experimental or population models of skin infection to support research into improved drugs, treatments, diagnostics or vaccines;
Innovative approaches to the discovery and development of drugs, diagnostics or vaccines;
Underlying pathology in diverse endemic populations that determines variation in response to diagnostics, drugs or vaccines;
Role of skin commensals and co-infections in disease.

                                                Michelson Found Animals is a nonprofit with a focused mission: saving pets, enriching lives.
The Michelson Grants in Reproductive Biology is a program that exists to incentivize research through grant funding to rapidly develop a permanent, single-dose, nonsurgical sterilant for male and female cats and dogs. A proposed project must pursue a technology, mechanism, or pathway representing an innovative approach to nonsurgical sterilization. Investigators are encouraged to submit for "proof of concept" studies in cell culture or rodents (in certain cases), and/or in dogs and cats.

                                                Throughout its history, BioMarin has worked tirelessly to make a difference by pursuing bold science. Our first approved therapy was inspired by a father who refused to accept that his son’s rare diagnosis lacked a viable therapy. That relentless pursuit to change the course of his son’s future through the power of treatment is at the core of who BioMarin is today.

                                                Rift Valley Fever:
Vaccine candidate is based on any platform which is not a live-attenuated platform.
Vaccine candidate is intended for use in humans (CEPI will not support development of exclusively veterinary RVF vaccines). 
While CEPI is open to candidates from applicants/developers globally, preference will be given to proposals from groups based in RVF-endemic regions (i.e., Africa and the Middle East), or with plans to conduct clinical evaluation of candidates in endemic areas.
 Pan-Sarbecovirus or other coronaviruses:
Vaccine candidate has preclinical proof-of-concept data, including evidence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and efficacy in a suitable animal challenge model (e.g., hamster) against Sarbecoviruses known to infect humans. This data must be shown in the application.
The applicant has advanced a SARS-CoV-2 candidate produced in the same platform into clinical development.
Lassa Fever:
Vaccine candidate has demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept, i.e., evidence of induction of antibody and T-cell responses. 
While CEPI is open to candidates from applicants/developers globally, preference will be given to proposals from groups based in Lassa Fever endemic regions in West Africa, or with plans to conduct clinical evaluation of candidates in these endemic areas. 
Nipah:
Vaccine candidate has demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept, i.e., immunogenicity and, ideally, efficacy in an animal challenge model against one of the common Nipah strains.
While CEPI is open to candidates from applicants/developers globally, preference will be given to proposals with plans to conduct clinical evaluation of candidates in Nipah affected countries. 
Global South developers are particularly encouraged to apply.

                                                CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We're working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, which caused significant morbidity, mortality, and disruption of normal life around the world, CEPI has set out a 100-Days Mission to make vaccines and other biologic countermeasures available more rapidly in response to an outbreak of a new pathogen, referred to as Disease X. The aim is to have vaccines ready for initial authorisation and manufacturing at scale within 100 days of recognition of a pandemic pathogen, when justified by the severity of the situation. Coupled with improved surveillance, and swift use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, a vaccine or other biologic countermeasure developed in 100 days could defuse the threat of a new pathogen with pandemic potential.
The objective for Focus Area 2 is to advance new candidates for CEPI priority pathogens and viral families, aligned with CEPI’s strategic objectives to accelerate development of vaccines against known high-risk pathogens and to build a library of vaccine prototypes from high-risk viral families to give a head-start on novel threats (Disease X).
The scope of Focus Area 2 will be amended periodically in response to evolving portfolio priorities and needs.

                                                The Fund for Innovation in Development (FID) supports innovation that contributes to reducing global poverty and inequality. Through flexible grant funding, the fund enables innovators and researchers to test new ideas, build rigorous evidence of what works, and scale the highest-impact and most cost-effective solutions. The Call for Proposals invites innovators and researchers from around the world to apply for grant funding to more effectively or efficiently address poverty and inequality. 
FID's Call for Proposals accepts applications for innovations in any sector which addresses poverty and inequality, and specifically encourages applications for innovations in education, health, climate change, and gender equality. Within each sector, FID particularly encourages applications centered on interventions that improve outcomes for marginalized groups, including, for example, women and girls, underrepresented minorities, and refugees and displaced persons.

                                                The Hello Tomorrow is a global non-profit on a mission to unlock the potential of deep technologies to solve the world's toughest challenges, by highlighting, empowering and connecting the most promising deeptech entrepreneurs across the globe with the right enablers.
The Hello Tomorrow Global Challenge is a worldwide renowned science & technology startup competition designed specifically to address the needs of deep tech entrepreneurs across several different industries and technologies. The Challenge was created in 2013 by deep tech entrepreneur Xavier Duportet and Arnaud De La Tour, at the time both PhD students, who realised that the resources needed to propel emerging technologies were different from those of traditional web and mobile innovations.
The Deep Tech Pioneers community and the Global Challenge are designed for deep tech startups or startup projects. Their goal is to promote entrepreneurs working on breakthrough technologies or scientific discoveries in any field and whose applications will lead to positive impact.

                                                The project duration must be between 18 and 36 months.
The project consortium must include at least one business entity from each country (Brazil and Switzerland) and one research institute accredited by EMBRAPII as “EMBRAPII unit”.
Participation of other research organisations and other commercial companies from both countries is welcome in accordance with the funding regulations of each country.
The research organisations and commercial companies must comply with the regulations of their respective countries.
To ensure that projects promote genuine international collaboration rather than internal company research, affiliated companies will be considered as a single entity under the parent company. Each Brazilian registered organisation involved in an application must be a separate legal entity, not linked to the Swiss partners or vice versa.
The project must demonstrate a relevant innovation content, added value and benefit from the bilateral cooperation in both countries.
No country may contribute more than 70% of the total person-months to the project. Person-months is the measure of the time in months that staff will devote to the project.
A draft consortium agreement, including intellectual property rights (IPR), must be submitted with the proposal.
Both agencies will only consider project costs incurred in their country as eligible. Cross-border funding is not foreseen.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to stimulate translation of scientific discoveries and engineering developments in imaging, data science and/or spectroscopic technologies into methods or tools that address contemporary problems in understanding the fundamental biology, potential risk of development, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer.
A distinguishing feature of each application to this NOFO will be formation of an academic-industrial partnership: a strategic alliance of academic and industrial investigators who work together as partners to identify and translate a technological solution for mitigation of a cancer (or other disease-related) problem. In this sense, the NOFO acts more as a funding mechanism for driving translational research in imaging than for a specific scientific or clinical research area. These partnerships are expected to solidify pre-existing collaborations or establish new ones that would drive the field of imaging, as a whole, further than if they had not been formed.
This NOFO defines innovation as the likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This funding announcement will support clinical trials that test functionality or validate performance in the chosen setting. However, this NOFO is not intended to support commercial production, basic research projects, or clinical trials that lack translation as the primary motivation.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to invite exploratory/developmental research grant applications (R21) for innovative informatics methods and algorithms to improve the acquisition, analysis, visualization, or interpretation of data across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. As a component of the NCI's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Program, the emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel informatics capabilities that involve a high degree of innovation that have the potential to accelerate or enhance research. To be successful, there must be a clear rationale for how the proposed informatics method or algorithm is novel and how it will benefit the cancer research field. Projects with a significant level of data generation and/or data analysis will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.

The purpose of this reissued Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support high-risk, high-impact, early discovery research on vaccine approaches to prevent acquisition of or ongoing infection by HIV. In keeping with the high-risk, high-impact nature of this research, this NOFO supports a Go/No-Go approach to funding high risk research, which is significantly different from most R01 projects. Continued funding for the full award duration is dependent upon achieving negotiated “Go/No-Go” criteria by the end of Year 2.

The funding opportunity announcement (FOA) encourages the development and validation of animal models and human/animal tissue ex vivo systems that recapitulate the phenotypic and physiologic characteristics of a defined neurological or neuromuscular disorder. The goal of the FOA is to promote a significant improvement in the translational relevance of animal models or ex vivo systems that will be utilized to facilitate future development of neurotherapeutics. Ideally, models proposed for this FOA would have the potential to provide feasible and meaningful assessments of efficacy following therapeutic intervention that would be applicable in both preclinical and clinical settings.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits grant applications proposing exploratory research projects focused on the early-stage development of highly innovative technologies offering novel molecular or cellular analysis capabilities for basic, clinical, or epidemiological cancer research. The emphasis of this NOFO is on supporting the development of novel capabilities involving a high degree of technical innovation for targeting, probing, or assessing molecular and cellular features of cancer biology. Well-suited applications must offer the potential to accelerate and/or enhance research in the areas of cancer biology, early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, control, epidemiology, and/or address issues associated with cancer health disparities. Technologies proposed for development may be intended to have widespread applicability but must be focused on improving molecular and/or cellular characterizations of cancer biology. Projects proposing the application of existing technologies where the novelty resides in the biological or clinical target/question being pursued are not responsive to this solicitation and will not be reviewed.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage clinical research that will identify and validate novel targets for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and substance use disorder (SUD)-relevant neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses to NIBS that may precede clinical outcomes like reduced craving or substance use.
This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available PEDP guidance material.
R61/R33: This NOFO uses a R61/R33 Phased Innovation award activity code to support applications that are expected to be exploratory and developmental in nature. As such, these studies may involve considerable risk of failure but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area that could have a major impact on SUD research involving NIBS.
R01: Types of studies that should submit under this NOFO include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage clinical research that will identify and validate
Novel targets for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to treat substance use disorders (SUD);
Substance use disorder (SUD)-relevant neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses to NIBS that may precede clinical outcomes like reduced craving or substance use.
Applications are expected to be exploratory and developmental in nature. As such, these studies may involve considerable risk of failure but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area that could have a major impact on SUD research involving NIBS. This NOFO uses a R61/R33 Phased Innovation award activity code to support applications that propose Basic Experimental Studies Involving Humans (BESH) that meet both the definition of basic research and the NIH definition of a clinical trial. 
Types of studies that should submit under this NOFO include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage exploratory/developmental research applications that propose to study the development, validation, feasibility, and effectiveness of innovative mobile health (mHealth) interventions or tools specifically suited for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that utilize new or emerging technology, platforms, systems, and/or analytics. The overall goal of the program is to catalyze innovation through multidisciplinary research that addresses global health problems, develop an evidence base for the use of mHealth technology to improve clinical and public health outcomes, and strengthen mHealth research capacity in LMICs.
This FOA provides support for up to two years (R21 phase) for technology development and feasibility studies, followed by a possible transition to expanded research support (R33 phase) for validation, larger-scale feasibility, and effectiveness studies. Transition to the R33 depends on the completion of applicant-defined milestones, as well as program priorities and the availability of funds. All applicants must address both the R21 and R33 phases.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage community-engaged research that broadens the conceptualization of qualities of the environment that can support language development in children and that focuses on the development of novel measures of children’s language development. The overall goal is to build the number of strengths-focused, culturally and linguistically responsive, and generalizable tools to further our understanding of children’s language development and/or impairment, and predictors thereof. 
R01: This NOFO requires a Community Engagement (CE) Plan, which will  be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a  CE Plan will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn.

                                                The story of The Water Research Foundation represents the evolution of water science—from siloed thinking to one that delivers the research and innovation needed to address the most pressing water issues holistically, while remaining true to our core mission to provide water sector leaders with the information needed to make informed decisions about the management of their water systems. We’ve come a long way—and we’re looking forward to addressing the new challenges on the horizon.
Project Objectives
To improve receiving water quality by fostering widespread adoption of disinfection practices and technologies, when needed, at strategic locations throughout sewersheds and at potential peak wet‐weather flow management points within water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) and stormwater treatment systems.
To identify cost‐effective solutions and develop a user-friendly guidance document to add to a utility’s decision toolbox for combined sewer overflow (CSO) and sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) mitigation strategies.

                                                The story of The Water Research Foundation represents the evolution of water science—from siloed thinking to one that delivers the research and innovation needed to address the most pressing water issues holistically, while remaining true to our core mission to provide water sector leaders with the information needed to make informed decisions about the management of their water systems. We’ve come a long way—and we’re looking forward to addressing the new challenges on the horizon.
This project will evaluate existing maintenance approaches for high-consequence valves, provide guidance on the evaluation of the approaches for valve assessment and maintenance (including the application of artificial intelligence (AI)), and inform an exploration of new maintenance approaches. Lastly, this project will provide useful communications materials and statistics to convey the importance of valves in a resilient distribution system, as well as valve rebuild methods for larger, more expensive valves.
This RFP is intentionally flexible in the research approach to encourage creativity and originality from proposers. Proposers should describe how they will conduct the research to meet the objectives listed above. The following approach is intended as a starting point.
Conduct a literature review to define high-consequence valves
Rely on existing data collected from utilities and/or their contractors actively engaged in maintenance activities on high-consequence valves
Conduct detailed case studies
Provide guidance for utilities to conduct the evaluation of approaches for valve assessment/maintenance and provide recommendations for minimizing interruptions to operations during valve inspection/testing/maintenance
Explore the application of AI

                                                O Conselho Nacional das Fundações Estaduais de Amparo à Pesquisa (CONFAP) é uma organização sem fins lucrativos, que tem por objetivo promover uma melhor articulação dos interesses das agências estaduais de fomento à pesquisa científica, tecnológica e de inovação no Brasil. Criado em 28 de abril de 2006, congrega 26 Fundações de Amparo à Pesquisa (FAPs), e trabalha como parte ativa do Sistema Nacional de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação.
O Horizon Europe é o nono programa-quadro europeu de Pesquisa e Inovação (2021-2027). A expectativa é que este programa ajude a fortalecer a base de conhecimento europeia por meio de pesquisas de fronteira, estimular inovações e apoiar o desenvolvimento e a demonstração de soluções inovadoras, além de ajudar a restaurar a indústria e a economia, ao mesmo tempo em que se enfrenta a pandemia de coronavírus e os desafios climáticos.

                                                O Conselho Nacional das Fundações Estaduais de Amparo à Pesquisa (CONFAP) é uma organização sem fins lucrativos, que tem por objetivo promover uma melhor articulação dos interesses das agências estaduais de fomento à pesquisa científica, tecnológica e de inovação no Brasil. Criado em 28 de abril de 2006, congrega 26 Fundações de Amparo à Pesquisa (FAPs), e trabalha como parte ativa do Sistema Nacional de Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação.
O Memorando de Entendimento (MoU) entre o Conselho Nacional das Fundações Estaduais de Amparo à Pesquisa (CONFAP) e Australian Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) viabiliza atividades que motivam pesquisadores australianos e brasileiros a atuarem conjuntamente em projetos de pesquisa; possibilita a mobilidade de pesquisadores, alunos de pós-doutorado e alunos de pós-graduação (incluindo doutorado e mestrado) entre os países (quando for autorizado a mobilidade pelas autoridades sanitárias de ambos os países em razão da pandemia de Covid-19); a realização de seminários, workshops e publicações para promover os resultados das atividades conjuntas; e a preparação e coordenação de outras atividades em conjunto que possibilitem o intercâmbio científico entre o Brasil e a Austrália.

                                                A iniciativa prevê a liberação de recursos em duas linhas de financiamento: a primeira, voltada para o desenvolvimento tecnológico, destina-se apenas aos microempreendedores individuais, startups, micro e pequenas empresas. A segunda é destinada ao encadeamento tecnológico e pode contar com empresas de todos os portes.
Poderão ser apoiados, no máximo, dois projetos por uma mesma MPE ou MEI, desde que tenham escopo e objetivos distintos. 
A empresa deve ter Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas (CNAE) industrial ou ligada à Tecnologia da Informação e Comunicação (TIC) e estar em dia com as suas obrigações fiscais e tributárias.
O nível de maturidade tecnológica do projeto deve ser intermediário (nem ainda na fase de pesquisa acadêmica nem quase pronto para o mercado).

Desenvolvimento tecnológico: aporte financeiro do Sebrae será de até 70% da contraparte da empresa no projeto e limitado ao valor de R$150 mil;
Encadeamento tecnológico: o valor máximo de aporte do Sebrae, por projeto contratado, será de 80% da contraparte da MEI e/ou MPE, até o limite de R$200 mil. A contrapartida da média e grande empresa que participa do projeto não pode ser inferior a 10% do valor total do projeto.
Após aprovado, a Embrapii aporta, no máximo, um terço dos recursos. Os dois terços restantes serão divididos entre a empresa, o Sebrae e a unidade Embrapii que desenvolverá o projeto (os recursos Embrapii e do Sebrae não são reembolsáveis).
Nota: O recurso não poderá ser usado para aquisição de equipamentos.

Os sistemas agroalimentares baseados na biodiversidade apresentam oportunidades para a consolidação da bioeconomia e da agricultura familiar brasileira desenvolvida sob bases sustentáveis. Tais oportunidades englobam o desenvolvimento de produtos, processos, tecnologias e serviços que poderão auxiliar o País em sua recuperação econômica pós-pandemia, gerando trabalho e renda a um grande número de comunidades que já desenvolvem atividades com os ativos da biodiversidade. Esta Seleção Pública objetiva conceder recursos de subvenção econômica para apoiar projetos que promovam soluções aos gargalos científicos e tecnológicos enfrentados na estruturação e fortalecimento de cadeias socioprodutivas baseadas na biodiversidade brasileira, desenvolvendo produtos, processos, tecnologias e serviços de modo a agregar e reter valor junto aos elos iniciais das cadeias e sistemas agroalimentares, melhorando a qualidade de vida das populações atendidas, promovendo a inclusão socioprodutiva e a transição agroecológica, bem como o aumento da disponibilidade de alimentos, fibras e outros produtos e serviços com o aumento da eficiência e sustentabilidade produtiva dos sistemas agroalimentares e florestais.

No caso de parceria entre empresas para o desenvolvimento do projeto, a principal responsável pelo desenvolvimento do produto ou processo inovador, com a realização de dispêndios para esse fim, deverá ser inscrita na proposta como “Proponente” e a(s) outra(s), que também realize(m) dispêndios relativos às etapas de desenvolvimento, como “Coexecutora(s)”. A participação da(s) Coexecutora(s) deverá ser efetiva e relevante na execução do projeto, não podendo se caracterizar como prestação de serviços. 
Instituições Científicas e Tecnológicas (ICTs) somente poderão participar do projeto como parceiras, devendo o cronograma de execução do projeto relacionar as atividades a serem executadas por tais instituições, com reflexo, ainda, na relação de itens do projeto, que deverá prever o pagamento do serviço de terceiros correspondente.
As propostas apresentadas deverão se basear em um dos dois formatos previstos de arranjo:
Arranjo Simples: Propostas poderão ser apresentadas por empresas brasileiras (proponentes), contando, necessariamente, com a participação de, pelo menos, 01 (uma) ICT. As propostas poderão contar com a participação de outra(s) empresa(s) brasileira(s) como coexecutora(s).
Arranjo em Rede: Propostas poderão ser apresentadas por empresas brasileiras (proponentes), necessariamente em conjunto com, pelo menos, 2 (duas) empresas brasileiras na condição de Coexecutoras, sendo, ainda, necessária a participação de pelo menos 01 (uma) ICT. Pelo menos 5% do valor subvencionado deve ser destinado a uma ou mais ICTs e uma das empresas (proponente ou coexecutoras) deve ter receita operacional bruta igual ou superior a R$ 16 milhões* no ano anterior ao de submissão da proposta.
Para enquadramento como Arranjo em Rede é necessário que nenhum partícipe integre o mesmo grupo econômico de outro partícipe. Os partícipes que excedam o arranjo mínimo (proponente, duas coexecutoras e ICT(s) cuja prestação de serviços some(m) 5% do valor solicitado) não estão sujeitas a esta restrição.

                                                The project duration must be between 18 and 36 months.
The project consortium must include at least one business entity from each country (Brazil and Switzerland) and one research institute accredited by EMBRAPII as “EMBRAPII unit”.
Participation of other research organisations and other commercial companies from both countries is welcome in accordance with the funding regulations of each country.
The research organisations and commercial companies must comply with the regulations of their respective countries.
To ensure that projects promote genuine international collaboration rather than internal company research, affiliated companies will be considered as a single entity under the parent company. Each Brazilian registered organisation involved in an application must be a separate legal entity, not linked to the Swiss partners or vice versa.
The project must demonstrate a relevant innovation content, added value and benefit from the bilateral cooperation in both countries.
No country may contribute more than 70% of the total person-months to the project. Person-months is the measure of the time in months that staff will devote to the project.
A draft consortium agreement, including intellectual property rights (IPR), must be submitted with the proposal.
Both agencies will only consider project costs incurred in their country as eligible. Cross-border funding is not foreseen.

                                                Provide awards primarily for translational and clinical research grants related to ataxia-telangiectasia. One and two-year projects are funded up to a maximum total direct cost of $75,000 per year. In rare instances, if a project involves the later phases of developing a therapy, we may consider a larger budget for which we would create a specific fundraising campaign.

                                                The A-T Children's Project is a non-profit organization that raises funds to support and coordinate biomedical research projects, scientific conferences and a clinical center aimed at finding life-improving therapies and a cure for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is a rare, genetic disease that attacks children, causing progressive loss of muscle control, cancer, and immune system problems.
The Research Grant Program supports promising research with sound scientific rationale. No idea is too novel for us to consider, as long as it has clear relevance for people with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) and the potential to lead to a therapy. We welcome applications from academia and industry scientists, small biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies, and even from venture capital firms that are incubating new technologies which may hold promise for A-T. Our portfolio spans basic, translational and clinical research.

                                                Throughout its history, BioMarin has worked tirelessly to make a difference by pursuing bold science. Our first approved therapy was inspired by a father who refused to accept that his son’s rare diagnosis lacked a viable therapy. That relentless pursuit to change the course of his son’s future through the power of treatment is at the core of who BioMarin is today.

                                                The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to harnessing the immune system's power to control and potentially cure all types of cancer. It funds the most innovative clinical and laboratory research around the world, support the next generation of the field's leaders, and serve as the trusted source of information on immunotherapy for cancer patients and their caregivers.
The Technology Impact Award provides seed funding to address the gap between technology development and clinical application of cancer immunotherapies. The grants aim to encourage collaboration between technology developers and clinical cancer immunologists and to generate the proof-of-principle of a novel platform technology in bioinformatics, ex vivo or in silico modeling systems, immunological or tumor profiling instrumentation, methods, reagents and assays, or other relevant technologies that can enable clinician scientists to generate deeper insights into the mechanisms of action of effective or ineffective cancer immunotherapies.

Component II awards are considered for more advanced programs that generally have identified a clinical candidate and are moving into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies such as PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and Phase 1/2 clinical trials in CF patients. Component II awards are typically supported at a level of up to $3 million-$5 million for two or more years and require substantial matching funds. Only direct costs are covered.

                                                The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), a nonprofit donor-supported organization, aims to assure the development of the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF) and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
The Path to a Cure: Industry Award Program aims to support development of treatments for the underlying cause of the disease and, ultimately, a cure for every person with CF. Awards may be made for either discovery, platform development for gene delivery and editing strategies, and preclinical and/or clinical development activities that support development of treatments that address the underlying cause of CF.
Industry programs supported through the Path to a Cure will focus on two core strategies to address the underlying cause of CF:
Restoring CFTR protein when none exists, including that from nonsense mutations;
Fixing or replacing the underlying genetic mutation to address the root cause of CF through gene replacement/transfer, gene editing approaches, or stem cell therapy.

                                                Applicants from all countries are welcome to apply. Applicants awarded in previous years cannot apply a second time.
Funding through the John Hansen Research Grant is dependent on the eligibility of the applicant: Applicant must have received a doctoral degree (PhD, MD, or equivalent achievements) in a field pertinent to the grant within the last 10 years from the grant call start date. Applicants whose careers have been interrupted after receiving a doctoral degree, may request an extension of the degree requirement insofar as the interruption occurred for example to one of the following reasons: family care responsibilities, applicant’s disability or illness, active duty community service. Such request for extension shall be initiated within the scope of the application phase by completing the Extension Request Form which will be provided on demand (grant@dkms.org). Upon request, the reasons leading to such a request must be substantiated by appropriate documentation. The requirement for extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Applicants must appoint a supervisor in his/her/its application. The supervisor should ideally be a senior scientist in the applicant’s host institution with experience in the research proposal topic, who can provide guidance and support for an adequate project progress.

                                                Dravet Syndrome Foundation (DSF), a non-profit organization, was founded by a group of parents with the purpose of expediting research to find a cure and better treatments for their afflicted children. The mission of DSF is to aggressively raise research funds for Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies; to increase awareness of these catastrophic conditions; and to provide support to affected individuals and families.
Research Grant Awards are intended for established, experienced, independent investigators affiliated with a research or academic institution whose proposed projects investigate hypotheses directly related to Dravet syndrome. Proposals are scored according to NIH guidelines based on the quality of preliminary data, research design, feasibility, investigator’s qualifications, and overall impact. 
Investigators applying for a research grant should ensure their proposed project addresses the needs of the Dravet syndrome community and DSF’s mission to support research toward better treatments and a cure for Dravet syndrome.
Our 2024 priority areas include:
Understanding the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in Dravet syndrome.
Development of enhanced models to study Dravet syndrome.
Understanding of the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of Dravet syndrome.
Revealing causes and interventions for comorbidities in Dravet syndrome.
Understanding causes and developing interventions for SUDEP.
Development of novel treatments and interventions that will prevent the onset or halt the progression of Dravet syndrome. This includes research that may overcome the current size and delivery hurdles for gene-therapy approaches.

                                                The principal purpose of the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation is to encourage, drive and fund research that will substantially improve outcomes for fibrolamellar patients. We envision a world where all people with fibrolamellar carcinoma will be diagnosed early, treated effectively and hopefully cured.
The research must focus on Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC) [aka Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FL-HCC)]. Studies should be intended to advance knowledge relevant to the understanding, diagnosis, epidemiology, or treatment of FLC. Of particular interest are applications showing a clear path towards a novel therapy / clinical trials with the ultimate goal of achieving a cure for FLC. The FCF will accept grant applications to support innovative and promising research projects towards the above goals.

                                                The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical research and projects targeting one clinical indication or organ. It is meant to fund research that could lead the way to a new reimbursable clinical application for image-guided FUS within five to seven years.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research that, if successful, could have a profound impact on the field of focused ultrasound and that could change the way many conditions are treated.
Researchers in the U.S. and abroad. Brazilian citizens are eligible.

                                                The Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation was founded in October, 2006, as a small, tax-exempt organization. But it has a driving, entrepreneurial spirit, and this mission: to develop new applications for focused ultrasound, and accelerate its worldwide adoption.
The General Awards Program provides funding for investigator-initiated clinical, preclinical, and early-stage research projects that fall outside our Brain, Cancer Immunotherapy, and Veterinary Programs through a competitive peer-reviewed application process.
The program has two tracks:
The Pre-Clinical Track is geared primarily towards preclinical studies and research projects that target a particular clinical indication or organ.
The High-Risk Track is intended for early-stage, high-risk, proof-of-concept research.

                                                The Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance (Fara) is a national, public, non-profit, tax-exempt organization dedicated to curing Friedrech’s Ataxia (FA) through research. Fara grants and activities provide support for basic and translational Fa research, pharmaceutical/biotech drug development, clinical trials, and scientific conferences.
The Kyle Bryant Translational Research Award honors its namesake for his diligent efforts to aid in the acceleration of preclinical studies to early pilot trials in Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) patients. This award is given to proposals focused on pre-clinical and clinical investigations that will advance treatments for FA.
The specific aims must target one or more of the following:
Identification of biomarkers for FA that will elucidate disease variability, severity, and prognosis; facilitate drug screening, and/or optimize selection of patients and clinical endpoints for clinical trials;
Development of tools and technologies that can: be directly used for therapy development, overcome existing obstacles to treatment and be directly applied to, or adapted for, delivery of potential therapeutics;
Pre-clinical development and testing of potential therapeutics, biologics, and devices in cells and animals;
Clinical studies of patient outcome measures.

                                                The Group Foundation for Advancing Mental Health is a philanthropic organization dedicated to changing lives through therapeutic group work by advancing the most effective and innovative approaches to group therapy education, training, research and community outreach.
The Research Grants aim to support clinical research reviews that demonstrate the effectiveness of group psychotherapy. More specifically the Foundation is interested in reviews of studies of:
Treatment outcome either for selected clinical issues (e.g., depression) or cost effectiveness;
Studies that examine specific process-outcome relationships (such as the association between interpretative work and outcome);
Specific group formats and approaches (such as psychoeducational groups for stress management);
Focus on individual differences that impact group treatment (such as race/class/gender or member attachment); or 
Comparisons of group therapy to other forms of treatment.

We have been funding catalytic and paradigm-changing research since our birth – including identifying the Huntington’s disease marker in 1983 and the HD gene in 1993, and supporting gene silencing approaches since 2002. We continue to make an impact by funding research that pushes the envelope. 
The Hereditary Disease Foundation provides Postdoctoral Fellowships and Grants to researchers to advance the discovery and development of treatments for Huntington’s disease and other brain disorders. We are passionate about finding and funding the most promising, creative and paradigm-changing research. Our Scientific Advisory Board is composed of over 30 distinguished scientists from around the world who set the scientific priorities for the Foundation. Each year, the Board reviews more than 100 grant and postdoctoral fellowship applications and selects the most groundbreaking research projects for funding.
The Foundation’s current focus:
Modifiers of phenotype and age of onset; 
Mechanisms of HD neurodegeneration;
Biomarkers of disease progression;
Therapy development for HD-induced neurodegeneration.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) seeks to support research aimed at holistic understanding of inter-individual or between-person differences in human pain conditions, focusing  on ‘Whole Person Health’ and enhancing pain treatment and management strategies towards personalized pain medicine. The goal of this NOFO is to support studies that focus on the collection of clinical and/or preclinical data to enable evidence-based modeling and understanding of inter-individual differences and/or heterogeneity of pain occurring with use of pain therapy/management, or with conditions such as a second pain condition, a comorbid health condition, a comorbid mental health condition, or conditions of use / misuse of opioids, alcohol or other substances.
Applicants are encouraged to develop and implement novel, multidisciplinary research approaches, and include investigators with complementary expertise to fulfill the project and program goals. Input from patients and caregivers on the goals of the project is highly encouraged. Rigorous data-driven and evidence-based research approaches supported under this NOFO are expected to provide better understanding of biological and/or biopsychosocial underpinnings of inter-individual differences, heterogeneity, and stratification of persons with lived pain experience, which would accelerate the development of evidence-based solutions toward precision pain medicine.

Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The NEI uses UG1 cooperative agreement awards to support investigator-initiated large-scale clinical trials, human gene-transfer, stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials. These projects are multifaceted and of high public health significance requiring clear delineation of study organization including roles and responsibilities and require careful performance oversight and monitoring.

These projects are multifaceted and of high public health significance requiring clear delineation of study organization including roles and responsibilities and require careful performance oversight and monitoring.
For purposes of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the proposed study must be intended to evaluate interventions aimed at screening, diagnosing, preventing, or treating vision disorders, or to compare the effectiveness of two or more established interventions.
The NEI UG1-supported studies are typically funded as a group of single-component companion grant awards including the Chair’s Grant, the Coordinating Center, and Resource Centers, when appropriate.
Specifically, this NOFO encourages applications for the Coordinating Center grant, which provides details of the Coordinating Center's responsibilities and operations.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
The NEI uses UG1 cooperative agreement awards to support investigator-initiated large-scale clinical trials, human gene-transfer, stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials. These projects are multifaceted and of high public health significance requiring clear delineation of study organization including roles and responsibilities and require careful performance oversight and monitoring.
For purposes of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the proposed study must be intended to evaluate interventions aimed at screening, diagnosing, preventing, or treating vision disorders, or to compare the effectiveness of two or more established interventions. The NEI UG1-supported studies are typically funded as a group of single-component companion grant awards including the Chair’s Grant, the Coordinating Center, and Resource Centers, when appropriate.
Specifically, this NOFO encourages applications for the Resource Center grant which provides imaging, laboratory, or other requisite services for a multi-center clinical trial or other complex or high-risk clinical trial.

The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support the development of neuromodulatory devices with behavioral treatment component as a treatment for Stimulant Use Disorder (StUD). Given the high rates of relapse and poor treatment outcomes in StUD, the objective is to target patients with vulnerable phenotype including those with reported qualitatively high levels of impulsivity, compulsivity, and cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, this NOFO concentrates on advancing treatment modalities combinations: pairing non-invasive neuromodulation (including, but not limited to transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, vagal stimulation, alternating current stimulation, low-intensity focused ultrasound, and others) with either known efficacious behavioral interventions (e.g., contingency management, cognitive behavioral therapy) or novel treatments.

                                                The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.
This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits grant applications proposing to utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, or other non-oncolytic viruses and their natural products to study the underlying mechanisms of the complex interactions between microorganisms, tumors, and the immune system, and to explore their clinical potential for cancer imaging, therapeutics or diagnostics. Projects can focus on using microorganisms as anti-tumor agents, as activators of anti-tumor immunity, or as delivery vehicles for treatment, diagnosis, or imaging, complementing or synergizing with existing tools and approaches. This FOA will support basic mechanistic and preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models. Applicants are encouraged to address both the microbial and tumor aspects of microbial tumor interactions relevant to microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), tumor imaging, tumor detection, or diagnosis.

                                                The International Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) Research Foundation (IMDTRF), a not-for-profit organization, aims to fund original research worldwide that contributes to the body of evidence related to MDT such as its usefulness and limitations.
The Primary Grant seeks grant applications to further research into the usefulness and limitations of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT). Consideration will be given to proposals examining basic and clinical sciences with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of care for musculoskeletal patients. Preference will be given to proposals that include functional outcomes assessments.
