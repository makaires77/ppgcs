In this paper, the application of knowledge graph to sales data relationships is studied, and the data source is obtained by taking the sales data relationship related to counterfeit tobacco and alcohol as an example. We built the relationship between sales data related to fake cigarettes and alcohol through data pre-processing, data governance, population identification of fake cigarettes and alcohol, information extraction, etc. We used the Neo4j database for storage and built the knowledge graph of the relationship between sales data related to fake cigarettes and alcohol. The experimental verification shows that based on the real information of fake cigarettes and alcohol, we can achieve a visual display of sales data and relationship information.",Dentro do Escopo,https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/125992349.pdf

Aligned with these principles are online learning platforms that offer free online courses that require no or minimal information from their students to democratize learning. Despite the benefits, the lack of user information challenges traditional recommendation systems and, when applied to education, impacts student experiences. This paper addresses the problem of limited student information in course recommendation systems. We tackle the problem by generating a semantically enriched vector-based representation of course content using an Open Knowledge Graph (DBpedia) and Topic Modeling methods, such as LDA and LSA and by collecting tracking events from log systems (Google Analytics) to create a hybrid recommendation system using content-based and collaborative filtering strategies for low-information scenarios. Our experiments use GCFGlobal.org, an online learning platform offering free self-paced online courses to 100 million people, to validate our approach. Results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the previous works in the field contributing to the creation of fairer recommendation systems.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

Microbes can impact the efficacy and toxicity of drugs through various pathways, as well as influence the occurrence and metastasis of tumors. In clinical practice, it is crucial to elucidate the association between microbes and diseases. Although traditional biological experiments accurately identify this association, they are time-consuming, expensive, and susceptible to experimental conditions. Consequently, conducting extensive biological experiments to screen potential microbe-disease associations becomes challenging. The computational methods can solve the above problems well, but the previous computational methods still have the problems of low utilization of node features and the prediction accuracy needs to be improved. To address this issue, we propose the DAEGCNDF model predicting potential associations between microbes and diseases. Our model calculates four similar features for each microbe and disease. These features are fused to obtain a comprehensive feature matrix representing microbes and diseases. Our model first uses the graph convolutional network module to extract low-rank features with graph information of microbes and diseases, and then uses a deep sparse Auto-Encoder to extract high-rank features of microbe-disease pairs, after which the low-rank and high-rank features are spliced to improve the utilization of node features. Finally, Deep Forest was used for microbe-disease potential relationship prediction. The experimental results show that combining low-rank and high-rank features helps to improve the model performance and Deep Forest has better classification performance than the baseline model.",Dentro do Escopo,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12859-023-05611-7.pdf
10.1007/s11116-023-10451-8,Article,2023-12-08,Mobility knowledge graph: review and its application in public transport,"Understanding human mobility in urban areas is crucial for transportation planning, operations, and online control. The availability of large-scale and diverse mobility data (e.g., smart card data, GPS data), provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, organizing and analyzing such data pose significant challenges. Knowledge graph (KG), a graph-based knowledge representation method, has been successfully applied in various domains but has limited applications in urban mobility. This paper aims to address this gap by reviewing existing KG studies, introducing the concept of a mobility knowledge graph (MKG), and proposing a general learning framework to construct MKG from smart card data. The MKG represents hidden travel activities between public transport stations, with stations as nodes and their relations as edges. Two decomposition approaches, rule-based and neural network-based models, are developed to extract MKG relations from smart card data, capturing latent spatiotemporal travel dependencies. The case study is conducted using smart card data from a heavily used urban railway system to validate the effectiveness of MKG in predicting individual trip destinations. The results demonstrate the significance of establishing an MKG database, as it assists in a typical problem of predicting individual trip destinations for public transport systems with only tap-in records. Additionally, the MKG framework offers potential for efficient data management and applications such as individual mobility prediction and personalized travel recommendations.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

Recent research has primarily centred on embedding-based approaches. Among these approaches, there is a growing interest in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to their ability to capture complex relationships and incorporate node attributes within KGs. Despite the presence of several surveys in this area, they often lack comprehensive investigations specifically targeting GNN-based approaches. Moreover, they tend to evaluate overall performance without analysing the impact of individual components and methods. To bridge these gaps, this paper presents a framework for GNN-based entity alignment that captures the key characteristics of these approaches. We conduct a fine-grained analysis of individual components and assess their influences on alignment results. Our findings highlight specific module options that significantly affect the alignment outcomes. By carefully selecting suitable methods for combination, even basic GNN networks can achieve competitive alignment results.",Dentro do Escopo,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11280-023-01221-8.pdf

Most approaches are limited to a single data type and do not consider interactions between features, leaving aside the complementary insights that multimodality and systems biology can provide. In this project, we demonstrate the use of graph theory for data integration via individual networks where nodes and edges are individual-specific. We showcase the consequences of early, intermediate, and late graph-based fusion of RNA-Seq data and histopathology whole-slide images for predicting cancer subtypes and severity. The methodology developed is as follows: (1) we create individual networks; (2) we compute the similarity between individuals from these graphs; (3) we train our model on the similarity matrices; (4) we evaluate the performance using the macro F1 score. Pros and cons of elements of the pipeline are evaluated on publicly available real-life datasets. We find that graph-based methods can increase performance over methods that do not study interactions. Additionally, merging multiple data sources often improves classification compared to models based on single data, especially through intermediate fusion.

They present a contextualized view of current research that supports discovery, re-use, reproducibility, monitoring, transparency and omni-comprehensive assessment. A Data Management Plan (DMP) contains information concerning both the research processes and the data collected, generated and/or re-used during a project’s lifetime. Automated solutions and workflows that connect DMPs with the actual data and other contextual information (e.g., publications, fundings) are missing from the landscape. DMPs being submitted as deliverables also limit their findability. In an open and FAIR-enabling research ecosystem information linking between research processes and research outputs is essential. ARGOS tool for FAIR data management contributes to the OpenAIRE Research Graph (RG) and utilises its underlying services and trusted sources to progressively automate validation and automations of Research Data Management (RDM) practices. Results A comparative analysis was conducted between the data models of ARGOS and OpenAIRE Research Graph against the DMP Common Standard. Following this, we extended ARGOS with export format converters and semantic tagging, and the OpenAIRE RG with a DMP entity and semantics between existing entities and relationships. This enabled the integration of ARGOS machine actionable DMPs (ma-DMPs) to the OpenAIRE OSG, enriching and exposing DMPs as FAIR outputs. Conclusions This paper, to our knowledge, is the first to introduce exposing ma-DMPs in OSGs and making the link between OSGs and DMPs, introducing the latter as entities in the research lifecycle. Further, it provides insight to ARGOS DMP service interoperability practices and integrations to populate the OpenAIRE Research Graph with DMP entities and relationships and strengthen both FAIRness of outputs as well as information exchange in a standard way.",Dentro do Escopo,https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13326-023-00297-5.pdf

As graph data, knowledge graphs accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world. It has been well-recognized that knowledge graphs effectively represent complex information; hence, they rapidly gain the attention of academia and industry in recent years. Thus to develop a deeper understanding of knowledge graphs, this paper presents a systematic overview of this field. Specifically, we focus on the opportunities and challenges of knowledge graphs. We first review the opportunities of knowledge graphs in terms of two aspects: (1) AI systems built upon knowledge graphs; (2) potential application fields of knowledge graphs.

However, medication prediction faces challenges due to complex relations within heterogeneous medical data. Existing studies primarily focus on the supervised mining of hierarchical relations between homogeneous codes in medical ontology graphs, such as diagnosis codes. Few studies consider the valuable relations, including synergistic relations between medications, concurrent relations between diseases, and therapeutic relations between medications and diseases from historical EMR. This limitation restricts prediction performance and application scenarios. Methods To address these limitations, we propose KAMPNet, a multi-sourced medical knowledge augmented medication prediction network. KAMPNet captures diverse relations between medical codes using a multi-level graph contrastive learning framework. Firstly, unsupervised graph contrastive learning with a graph attention network encoder captures implicit relations within homogeneous medical codes from the medical ontology graph, generating knowledge augmented medical code embedding vectors. Then, unsupervised graph contrastive learning with a weighted graph convolutional network encoder captures correlative relations between homogeneous or heterogeneous medical codes from the constructed medical codes relation graph, producing relation augmented medical code embedding vectors. Finally, the augmented medical code embedding vectors, along with supervised medical code embedding vectors, are fed into a sequential learning network to capture temporal relations of medical codes and predict medications for patients. Results Experimental results on the public MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our KAMPNet model over several baseline models, as measured by Jaccard, F1 score, and PR-AUC for medication prediction. Conclusions Our KAMPNet model can effectively capture the valuable relations between medical codes inherent in multi-sourced medical knowledge using the proposed multi-level graph contrastive learning framework. Moreover, The multi-channel sequence learning network facilitates capturing temporal relations between medical codes, enabling comprehensive patient representations for downstream tasks such as medication prediction.",Dentro do Escopo,https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12911-023-02325-x.pdf

Extracting relevant features from these medical records and constructing a knowledge graph can significantly contribute to an efficient data analysis and decision support system for breast cancer diagnosis. Methods An approach was proposed to develop a workflow for effectively extracting breast cancer-related features from Chinese breast cancer mammography reports and constructing a knowledge graph for breast cancer diagnosis. Firstly, the concept layer of the knowledge graph for breast cancer diagnosis was constructed based on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment guidelines, along with insights from clinical experts. .Next, a BiLSTM-Highway-CRF model was designed to extract the mammography features, which formed the data layer of the knowledge graph. Finally, the knowledge graph was constructed by combining the concept layer and the data layer in a Neo4j graph data platform, and then applied in visualization analysis, semantic query and computer assisted diagnosis. Results Mammographic features were extracted from a total of 1171 mammography examination reports. The overall extraction performance of the model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.16%, a recall rate of 98.06%, and a F1 score of 97.61%. Additionally, 47,660 relationships between entities were identified based on the four different types of relationships defined in the concept layer. The knowledge graph for breast cancer diagnosis was constructed after inputting mammographic features and relationships into the Neo4j graph data platform. The model was assessed from the concept layer, data layer, and application layer perspectives, and showed promising results. Conclusions The proposed workflow is applicable for constructing knowledge graphs for breast cancer diagnosis based on Chinese EMRs. This study serves as a reference for the rapid design, construction, and application of knowledge graphs for diagnosis and treatment of other diseases. Furthermore, it offers a potential solution to address the issues of limited data sharing and format inconsistencies present in Chinese EMR data.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

GNNs have recently become popular because of their ability to obtain a contextual representation of each node taking into account information from its surroundings. However, existing work has focused on the development of GNN architectures, using basic domain-specific information about the nodes to compute embeddings. Meanwhile, in the closely-related area of knowledge graphs, much effort has been put towards developing deep learning techniques to obtain node embeddings that preserve information about relationships and structure without relying on domain-specific data. The potential application of deep embeddings of knowledge graphs in GNNs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we carry out a number of experiments to answer open research questions about the impact on GNNs performance when combined with deep embeddings. We test 7 different deep embeddings across several attribute prediction tasks in two state-of-art attribute-rich datasets.

Together with the lack of overlapping repertoire coverage, this limits cross-corpus studies on harmony over time and across genres, and hampers research in computational music analysis (chord recognition, pattern mining, computational creativity), which needs access to large datasets. We contribute to address this gap, by releasing the Chord Corpus (ChoCo), a large-scale dataset that semantically integrates harmonic data from 18 different sources using heterogeneous representations and formats (Harte, Leadsheet, Roman numerals, ABC, etc.). We rely on JAMS (JSON Annotated Music Specification), a popular data structure for annotations in Music Information Retrieval, to represent and enrich chord-related information (chord, key, mode, etc.) in a uniform way.

Recently, embedding methods have been used for entity alignment tasks, that learn a vector-space representation of entities which preserves their similarity in the original KGs. A wide variety of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods have been proposed that exploit both factual (attribute based) and structural information (relation based) of entities in the KGs. Still, a quantitative assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in real-world KGs according to different performance metrics and KG characteristics is missing from the literature. In this work, we conduct the first meta-level analysis of popular embedding methods for entity alignment, based on a statistically sound methodology.

Most of the data in RSs can be organized into graphs where various objects (e.g. users, items, and attributes) are explicitly or implicitly connected and influence each other via various relations. Such a graph-based organization brings benefits to exploiting potential properties in graph learning (e.g. random walk and network embedding) techniques to enrich the representations of the user and item nodes, which is an essential factor for successful recommendations.

This trend is reflected by the growing amount of clinical research on oligogenic diseases, where disease manifestations are influenced by combinations of variants on a few specific genes. Although statistical machine-learning methods have been developed to identify relevant genetic variant or gene combinations associated with oligogenic diseases, they rely on abstract features and black-box models, posing challenges to interpretability for medical experts and impeding their ability to comprehend and validate predictions. In this work, we present a novel, interpretable predictive approach based on a knowledge graph that not only provides accurate predictions of disease-causing gene interactions but also offers explanations for these results. Results We introduce BOCK, a knowledge graph constructed to explore disease-causing genetic interactions, integrating curated information on oligogenic diseases from clinical cases with relevant biomedical networks and ontologies. Using this graph, we developed a novel predictive framework based on heterogenous paths connecting gene pairs. This method trains an interpretable decision set model that not only accurately predicts pathogenic gene interactions, but also unveils the patterns associated with these diseases. A unique aspect of our approach is its ability to offer, along with each positive prediction, explanations in the form of subgraphs, revealing the specific entities and relationships that led to each pathogenic prediction. Conclusion Our method, built with interpretability in mind, leverages heterogenous path information in knowledge graphs to predict pathogenic gene interactions and generate meaningful explanations. This not only broadens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying oligogenic diseases, but also presents a novel application of knowledge graphs in creating more transparent and insightful predictors for genetic research.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

Results We propose a novel approach to predict gene-disease associations using rich semantic representations based on knowledge graph embeddings over multiple ontologies linked by logical definitions and compound ontology mappings. The experiments showed that considering richer knowledge graphs significantly improves gene-disease prediction and that different knowledge graph embeddings methods benefit more from distinct types of semantic richness.

However, learning on biomedical knowledge graphs can be challenging due to the dominance of genes and a small number of drug and disease entities, resulting in less effective representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a “semantic multi-layer guilt-by-association"" approach that leverages the principle of guilt-by-association - “similar genes share similar functions"", at the drug-gene-disease level. Using this approach, our model DREAMwalk: Drug Repurposing through Exploring Associations using Multi-layer random walk uses our semantic information-guided random walk to generate drug and disease-populated node sequences, allowing for effective mapping of both drugs and diseases in a unified embedding space. Compared to state-of-the-art link prediction models, our approach improves drug-disease association prediction accuracy by up to 16.8%. Moreover, exploration of the embedding space reveals a well-aligned harmony between biological and semantic contexts.

This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive taxonomy and a bird’s eye view of healthcare KG construction. Additionally, a thorough examination of the current state-of-the-art techniques drawn from academic works relevant to various healthcare contexts is carried out.

Various biomedical knowledge graphs exist, however, they require further extension with relations between food and biomedical entities. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three state-of-the-art relation-mining pipelines (FooDis, FoodChem and ChemDis) which extract relations between food, chemical and disease entities from textual data. We perform two case studies, where relations were automatically extracted by the pipelines and validated by domain experts. The results show that the pipelines can extract relations with an average precision around 70%, making new discoveries available to domain experts with reduced human effort, since the domain experts should only evaluate the results, instead of finding, and reading all new scientific papers.",Dentro do Escopo,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34981-4.pdf

Many existing methods are purely data driven, focusing on exploiting the intrinsic topology and construction rules of molecules without any chemical prior information. The high data dependency makes them difficult to generalize to a wider chemical space and leads to a lack of interpretability of predictions. Here, to address this issue, we introduce a chemical element-oriented knowledge graph to summarize the basic knowledge of elements and their closely related functional groups. We further propose a method for knowledge graph-enhanced molecular contrastive learning with functional prompt (KANO), exploiting external fundamental domain knowledge in both pre-training and fine-tuning. Specifically, with element-oriented knowledge graph as a prior, we first design an element-guided graph augmentation in contrastive-based pre-training to explore microscopic atomic associations without violating molecular semantics. Then, we learn functional prompts in fine-tuning to evoke the downstream task-related knowledge acquired by the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that KANO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on 14 molecular property prediction datasets and provides chemically sound explanations for its predictions. This work contributes to more efficient drug design by offering a high-quality knowledge prior, interpretable molecular representation and superior prediction performance.",Dentro do Escopo,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00654-0.pdf

Using these components, Plumber dynamically generates suitable knowledge extraction pipelines and offers overall 432 distinct pipelines. We study the optimization problem of choosing optimal pipelines based on input sentences. To do so, we train a transformer-based classification model that extracts contextual embeddings from the input and finds an appropriate pipeline. We study the efficacy of Plumber for extracting the KG triples using standard datasets over three KGs: DBpedia, Wikidata, and Open Research Knowledge Graph.

However, due to modern silk weaving technology advancements, aesthetic style evolution, and inadequate public recognition of Yunjin culture, the art faces a decline in market recognition and practitioners, posing a risk to its preservation. Addressing this issue necessitates product innovation, efficient knowledge storage, management, and utilization, and enhancing public cultural identity for Yunjin. Following the government’s “productive conservation” concept for intangible cultural heritage (ICH) projects in the handicraft category, this study uses Yunjin video resources as the primary data source. It constructs a domain knowledge graph (DKG) using an ontological approach to effectively and systematically preserve Yunjin knowledge. Furthermore, the study leverages Neo4j network topology to reveal intricate and diverse relationships within Yunjin knowledge, uncovering rich cultural connotations. Lastly, Cypher is employed for semantic queries, graph visualization, and domain expert evaluation. Evaluation results indicate that the constructed Yunjin DKG meets quality standards, supporting the development of products that align with market aesthetics while preserving Yunjin’s intrinsic cultural values. This approach fosters a complementary relationship between economic benefits and ICH.

One of the main challenges in building KGs is the extraction of named entities (nodes) and their relations (edges), particularly when processing unstructured text as it has no semantic descriptions. Generating KGs from texts written in Spanish represents a research challenge as the existing structures, models, and strategies designed for other languages are not compatible in this scenario. This paper proposes a method to design and construct KGs from unstructured text in Spanish. We defined lexical patterns to extract named entities and (non) taxonomic, equivalence, and composition relations. Next, named entities are linked and enriched with DBpedia resources through a strategy based on SPARQL queries. Finally, OWL properties are defined from the predicate relations for creating resource description framework (RDF) triples. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method to determine the degree of elements extracted from the input text and to assess their quality through standard information retrieval measures. The evaluation revealed the feasibility of the proposed method to extract RDF triples from datasets in general and computer science domains.

It is shown that through rule-based model generation by a design compiler in the form of a design graph as a central data model, a cross-domain data consistency is achieved.

Among the existing event log formats, the IEEE standard eXtensible Event Stream ( XES ) is the most widely adopted. In XES , each event must be related to a single case object, which may lead to convergence and divergence problems. To solve such issues, object-centric approaches become promising, where objects are the central notion and one event may refer to multiple objects. In particular, the Object-Centric Event Logs ( OCEL ) standard has been proposed recently. However, the crucial problem of extracting OCEL logs from external sources is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by leveraging the Virtual Knowledge Graph ( VKG ) approach to access data in relational databases. We have implemented this approach in the OnProm system, extending it to support both XES and OCEL standards. We have carried out an experiment with OnProm over the Dolibarr system.

However, such methods that utilize entire embedded Knowledge Graph (KG) without applying information-relevance regulatory constraints fail to stop the noise penetration into the underlying information. Moreover, higher computational time complexity is a CPU overhead in KG-enhanced systems and applications. The occurrence of these limitations significantly degrade the recommendation performance. Therefore, to cope with these challenges we proposed novel KGEE (Knowledge Graph Embedding Enhancement) approach of Hashing-based Semantic-relevance Attributed Graph-embedding Enhancement (H-SAGE) to model semantically-relevant higher-order entities and relations into the unique Meta-paths. For this purpose, we introduced Node Relevance-based Guided-walk (NRG) modeling technique. Further, to deal with the computational time-complexity, we converted the relevant information to the Hash-codes and proposed Deep-Probabilistic (dProb) technique to place hash-codes in the relevant hash-buckets. Again, we used dProb to generate guided function-calls to maximize the possibility of Hash-Hits in the hash-buckets. In case of Hash-Miss, we applied Locality Sensitive (LS) hashing to retrieve the required information.

Subnetworks that are relevant to the classification (referred to as “disease subnetworks”) are detected using explainable AI. Federated learning is enabled by dividing the knowledge graph into relevant subnetworks, constructing an ensemble classifier, and allowing domain experts to analyze and manipulate detected subnetworks using a developed user interface. Furthermore, the human-in-the-loop principle can be applied with the incorporation of experts, interacting through a sophisticated User Interface (UI) driven by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) methods, changing the datasets to create counterfactual explanations.

While so-called second wave statistical machine learning techniques are beginning to accelerate the materials development cycle, most materials science applications are data-deprived when compared to the vastness and complexity of the search space of possible solutions. In line with DARPA’s vision of third wave AI approaches, we believe a combination of data-driven statistical machine learning and domain knowledge will be required to achieve a true revolution in materials discovery.

These diverse conceptual constructs indicate multi-dimensional rather than two-dimensional relationships. This paper provides the first tensor-based treatment of hetero-functional graph theory. In particular, it addresses the “system concept” and the hetero-functional adjacency matrix from the perspective of tensors and introduces the hetero-functional incidence tensor as a new data structure.

This makes it difficult to keep track of where novel AI methods are successfully – or still unsuccessfully – applied, how progress is measured, how different advances might synergize with each other, and how future research should be prioritized. To help address these issues, we created the Intelligence Task Ontology and Knowledge Graph (ITO), a comprehensive, richly structured and manually curated resource on artificial intelligence tasks, benchmark results and performance metrics. The current version of ITO contains 685,560 edges, 1,100 classes representing AI processes and 1,995 properties representing performance metrics. The primary goal of ITO is to enable analyses of the global landscape of AI tasks and capabilities. ITO is based on technologies that allow for easy integration and enrichment with external data, automated inference and continuous, collaborative expert curation of underlying ontological models.

The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions^ 3 , 4 . Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19 million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.

However, hierarchical clustering depends strongly on the topological overlap measure. In other words, this algorithm may assign two genes with low topological overlap to different modules even though their expression patterns are similar. Here, a novel gene module clustering algorithm for WGCNA is proposed. We develop a gene module clustering network (gmcNet), which simultaneously addresses single-level expression and topological overlap measure. The proposed gmcNet includes a “co-expression pattern recognizer” (CEPR) and “module classifier”. The CEPR incorporates expression features of single genes into the topological features of co-expressed ones. Given this CEPR-embedded feature, the module classifier computes module assignment probabilities. We validated gmcNet performance using 4,976 genes from 20 native Korean cattle. We observed that the CEPR generates more robust features than single-level expression or topological overlap measure. Given the CEPR-embedded feature, gmcNet achieved the best performance in terms of modularity (0.261) and the differentially expressed signal (27.739) compared with other clustering methods tested. Furthermore, gmcNet detected some interesting biological functionalities for carcass weight, backfat thickness, intramuscular fat, and beef tenderness of Korean native cattle. Therefore, gmcNet is a useful framework for WGCNA module clustering.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

Resources with dereferenceable URIs (uniform resource identifiers) can employ the hyperlink encoding channel or image marks in Vega-Lite to amplify the information content of a given data graphic, and published charts populate a browsable gallery of the database. We discuss design considerations that arise in relation to portability, persistence, and performance.

Predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations can help to detect disease biomarkers and perform disease analysis and prevention. Establishing effective computational methods for lncRNA-disease association prediction is critical. Results In this paper, we propose a novel model named MAGCNSE to predict underlying lncRNA-disease associations. We first obtain multiple feature matrices from the multi-view similarity graphs of lncRNAs and diseases utilizing graph convolutional network. Then, the weights are adaptively assigned to different feature matrices of lncRNAs and diseases using the attention mechanism. Next, the final representations of lncRNAs and diseases is acquired by further extracting features from the multi-channel feature matrices of lncRNAs and diseases using convolutional neural network. Finally, we employ a stacking ensemble classifier, consisting of multiple traditional machine learning classifiers, to make the final prediction. The results of ablation studies in both representation learning methods and classification methods demonstrate the validity of each module. Furthermore, we compare the overall performance of MAGCNSE with that of six other state-of-the-art models, the results show that it outperforms the other methods. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of using multi-view data of lncRNAs and diseases. Case studies further reveal the outstanding ability of MAGCNSE in the identification of potential lncRNA-disease associations.

To address these challenges, there is an urgent need to inspire and encourage scientists to propose and pursue innovative research studies that aim to uncover the genetic and molecular causes of more rare diseases and ultimately to identify effective therapeutic solutions. A clear understanding of current research efforts, knowledge/research gaps, and funding patterns as scientific evidence is crucial to systematically accelerate the pace of research discovery in rare diseases, which is an overarching goal of this study. Methods To semantically represent NIH funding data for rare diseases and advance its use of effectively promoting rare disease research, we identified NIH funded projects for rare diseases by mapping GARD diseases to the project based on project titles; subsequently we presented and managed those identified projects in a knowledge graph using Neo4j software, hosted at NCATS, based on a pre-defined data model that captures semantics among the data. With this developed knowledge graph, we were able to perform several case studies to demonstrate scientific evidence generation for supporting rare disease research discovery. Results Of 5001 rare diseases belonging to 32 distinct disease categories, we identified 1294 diseases that are mapped to 45,647 distinct, NIH-funded projects obtained from the NIH ExPORTER by implementing semantic annotation of project titles. To capture semantic relationships presenting amongst mapped research funding data, we defined a data model comprised of seven primary classes and corresponding object and data properties. A Neo4j knowledge graph based on this predefined data model has been developed, and we performed multiple case studies over this knowledge graph to demonstrate its use in directing and promoting rare disease research. Conclusion We developed an integrative knowledge graph with rare disease funding data and demonstrated its use as a source from where we can effectively identify and generate scientific evidence to support rare disease research.

When presented with relational data, such as various forms of graphs, the logic program interpreter dynamically unfolds differentiable computation graphs to be used for the program parameter optimization by standard means. Following from the declarative, relational logic-based encoding, this results into a unified representation of a wide range of neural models in the form of compact and elegant learning programs, in contrast to the existing procedural approaches operating directly on the computational graph level. We illustrate how this idea can be used for a concise encoding of existing advanced neural architectures, with the main focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Importantly, using the framework, we also show how the contemporary GNN models can be easily extended towards higher expressiveness in various ways.

The analysis was carried out with a new method based on the combined use of a 3 Way Decisions model and graph theory. Specifically, the data about infected people in the Italian regions is assessed by means of an evaluation function which allows the tri-partitioning of Italy and the identification of high, medium or low critical regions. The tri-partition is performed, along the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 diffusion, by calculating two threshold values which take into account the containment actions that, from time to time, the decision makers have implemented. The effects of a containment action are related to a reduction in the centrality value of a region. To estimate the effect of containment actions, we evaluated two approaches. The first is based on a uniform reduction in the centrality values of the regions, the second estimates the effects of containment actions starting from the mobility changes data provided by the Google Community Mobility reports.

Existing methods for tag-clouds generations are mostly based on text content of documents, others also consider statistical or semantic information to enrich the document summary, while precious information deriving from multimedia content is often neglected. In this paper we present a document summarization and visualization technique based on both statistical and semantic analysis of textual and visual contents.

The semantic information is derived from a knowledge base where concepts are represented through several multimedia items. The Visual Semantic Tag Cloud can be used not only to synthesize a document but also to represent a set of documents grouped by categories using a topic detection technique based on textual and visual analysis of multimedia features.

An ever-growing number of scientific studies in several domains result into a massive amount of data, from which obtaining new knowledge requires computational help. For example, Alzheimer’s Disease, a life-threatening degenerative disease that is not yet curable. As the scientific community strives to better understand it and find a cure, great amounts of data have been generated, and new knowledge can be produced. A proper representation of such knowledge brings great benefits to researchers, to the scientific community, and consequently, to society. Methods In this article, we study and evaluate a semi-automatic method that generates knowledge graphs (KGs) from biomedical texts in the scientific literature. Our solution explores natural language processing techniques with the aim of extracting and representing scientific literature knowledge encoded in KGs. Our method links entities and relations represented in KGs to concepts from existing biomedical ontologies available on the Web. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by generating KGs from unstructured texts obtained from a set of abstracts taken from scientific papers on the Alzheimer’s Disease. We involve physicians to compare our extracted triples from their manual extraction via their analysis of the abstracts. The evaluation further concerned a qualitative analysis by the physicians of the generated KGs with our software tool. Results The experimental results indicate the quality of the generated KGs. The proposed method extracts a great amount of triples, showing the effectiveness of our rule-based method employed in the identification of relations in texts. In addition, ontology links are successfully obtained, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the ontology linking method proposed in this investigation. Conclusions We demonstrate that our proposal is effective on building ontology-linked KGs representing the knowledge obtained from biomedical scientific texts.

As the cumulative scientific understanding and underlying evidence for these diseases have expanded over time, existing practices to generate knowledge from these publications and resources have not been able to keep pace. Through determining the applicability of computational approaches to enhance or replace manual curation tasks, we aim to both improve the sustainability and relevance of consumer health information, but also to develop a foundational database, from which translational science researchers may start to unravel disease characteristics that are vital to the research process. Results We developed a meta-ontology based integrative knowledge graph for rare diseases in Neo4j. This integrative knowledge graph includes a total of 3,819,623 nodes and 84,223,681 relations from 34 different biomedical data resources, including curated drug and rare disease associations. Semi-automatic mappings were generated for 2154 unique FDA orphan designations to 776 unique GARD diseases, and 3322 unique FDA designated drugs to UNII, as well as 180,363 associations between drug and indication from Inxight Drugs, which were integrated into the knowledge graph. We conducted four case studies to demonstrate the capabilities of this integrative knowledge graph in accelerating the curation of scientific understanding on rare diseases through the generation of disease mappings/profiles and pathogenesis associations. Conclusions By integrating well-established database resources, we developed an integrative knowledge graph containing a large volume of biomedical and research data. Demonstration of several immediate use cases and limitations of this process reveal both the potential feasibility and barriers of utilizing graph-based resources and approaches to support their use by providers of consumer health information, such as GARD, that may struggle with the needs of maintaining knowledge reliant on an evolving and growing evidence-base.

First, we propose a distributed runtime model to capture the operational state and the context information of a smart CPS using directed, typed and attributed graphs as high-level knowledge representation. The runtime model is distributed among the participating nodes, and it is consistently kept up to date in a continuously evolving environment by a time-triggered model management protocol. Our runtime models offer a (domain-specific) model query and manipulation interface over the reliable communication middleware of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard widely used in the CPS domain. Then, we propose to carry out distributed runtime monitoring by capturing critical properties of interest in the form of graph queries, and design a distributed graph query evaluation algorithm for evaluating such graph queries over the distributed runtime model. As the key innovation, our (1) distributed runtime model extends existing publish–subscribe middleware (like DDS) used in real-time CPS applications by enabling the dynamic creation and deletion of graph nodes (without compile time limits). Moreover, (2) our distributed query evaluation extends existing graph query techniques by enabling query evaluation in a real-time, resource-constrained environment while still providing scalable performance. Our approach is illustrated, and an initial scalability evaluation is carried out on the MoDeS3 CPS demonstrator and the open Train Benchmark for graph queries.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

This task is a challenging problem for various reasons, including the lack of metadata (e.g., table and column names), the noisiness, heterogeneity, incompleteness and ambiguity in the data. The results of this task provide significant insights about potentially highly valuable tabular data, as recent works have shown, enabling a new family of data analytics and data science applications. Despite significant amount of work on various flavors of this problem, there is a lack of a common framework to conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art systems.

A similarity search algorithm is then applied to a related organism to infer possible function of these predicted transcripts. While some of these predictions may be inaccurate and transcripts with low coverage are often missed, we observe that it is possible to obtain a more complete set of transcripts to facilitate possible functional assignments by starting the search from the intermediate de Bruijn graph that contains all branching possibilities. Results We develop an algorithm to extract similar transcripts in a related organism by starting the search from the de Bruijn graph that represents the transcriptome instead of from predicted transcripts. We show that our algorithm is able to recover more similar transcripts than existing algorithms, with large improvements in obtaining longer transcripts and a finer resolution of isoforms. We apply our algorithm to study salt and waterlogging tolerance in two Melilotus species by constructing new RNA-Seq libraries. Conclusions We have developed an algorithm to identify paths in the de Bruijn graph that correspond to similar transcripts in a related organism directly. Our strategy bypasses the transcript prediction step in RNA-Seq data and makes use of support from evolutionary information.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

Methods In this paper, we build a novel tool QAnalysis, where doctors enter their analytic requirements in their natural language and then the tool returns charts and tables to the doctors. For a given question from a user, we first segment the sentence, and then we use grammar parser to analyze the structure of the sentence. After linking the segmentations to concepts and predicates in knowledge graphs, we convert the question into a set of triples connected with different kinds of operators. These triples are converted to queries in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j. Finally, the query is executed on Neo4j, and the results shown in terms of tables and charts are returned to the user. Results The tool supports top 50 questions we gathered from two hospital departments with the Delphi method. We also gathered 161 questions from clinical research papers with statistical requirements on EMR data. Experimental results show that our tool can directly cover 78.20% of these statistical questions and the precision is as high as 96.36%. Such extension is easy to achieve with the help of knowledge-graph technology we have adopted. The recorded demo can be accessed from https://github.com/NLP-BigDataLab/QAnalysis-project .

Prioritizing the genomic variants by considering only the genotype information usually identifies a few hundred potential variants. Narrowing it down further to find the causal disease genes and relating them to the observed clinical phenotypes remains a significant challenge, especially for rare diseases. Methods We propose a phenotype-driven gene prioritization approach using heterogeneous networks in the context of rare diseases. Towards this, we first built a heterogeneous network consisting of ontological associations as well as curated associations involving genes, diseases, phenotypes and pathways from multiple sources. Motivated by the recent progress in spectral graph convolutions, we developed a graph convolution based technique to infer new phenotype-gene associations from this initial set of associations. We included these inferred associations in the initial network and termed this integrated network HANRD (Heterogeneous Association Network for Rare Diseases). We validated this approach on 230 recently published rare disease clinical cases using the case phenotypes as input. Results When HANRD was queried with the case phenotypes as input, the causal genes were captured within Top-50 for more than 31% of the cases and within Top-200 for more than 56% of the cases. The results showed improved performance when compared to other state-of-the-art tools. Conclusions In this study, we showed that the heterogeneous network HANRD, consisting of curated, ontological and inferred associations, helped improve causal gene identification in rare diseases.

We investigate how and to what extent exploratory search can be supported on EKGs of architectural knowledge. We propose an approach for building exploratory search systems on EKGs and demonstrate its use within Siemens, which resulted in the STAR system used in practice by 200–300 software architects. We found that the EKG’s ontology allows making previously implicit organisational knowledge explicit and this knowledge informs the design of suitable relatedness metrics to support exploration.

Particularly, the daunting demands for caring for elders are unmet by the overall supply of caring capacities. There are at least two aspects of this imbalance: first, the number of high quality caring professionals with nursing backgrounds have been insufficient and this trend will continue in the near future; second, most of the current professional and semi-professional caregivers have limited education that in turn limited their caring capacities. To tackle these issues with the rapid development of data science and growing awareness of nursing informatics, we are working on building a knowledge graph for eldercare. In this paper, we propose the concrete first step towards this goal: constructing an eldercare entity graph based on international guidelines, and this is first of its kind to our best knowledge. Protégé is used to construct the entity graph that consists of eight types of entities and four types of relationships.

Although lots of efforts have been made on keyphrase extraction, most of the existing methods (the co-occurrence-based methods and the statistic-based methods) do not take semantics into full consideration. The co-occurrence-based methods heavily depend on the co-occurrence relations between two words in the input document, which may ignore many semantic relations. The statistic-based methods exploit the external text corpus to enrich the document, which introduce more unrelated relations inevitably.

In practice, in many real-world graphs, the graph vertices and edges need to be associated with descriptive attributes. Such type of graphs are referred to as attributed graphs . G-SPARQL has been proposed as an expressive language, with a centralized execution engine, for querying attributed graphs. G-SPARQL supports various types of graph querying operations including reachability, pattern matching and shortest path where any G-SPARQL query may include value-based predicates on the descriptive information (attributes) of the graph edges/vertices in addition to the structural predicates. In general, a main limitation of centralized systems is that their vertical scalability is always restricted by the physical limits of computer systems. This article describes the design, implementation in addition to the performance evaluation of DG-SPARQL , a distributed , hybrid and adaptive parallel execution engine of G-SPARQL queries. In this engine, the topology of the graph is distributed over the main memory of the underlying nodes while the graph data are maintained in a relational store which is replicated on the disk of each of the underlying nodes. DG-SPARQL evaluates parts of the query plan via SQL queries which are pushed to the underlying relational stores while other parts of the query plan, as necessary, are evaluated via indexless memory-based graph traversal algorithms.

Neither knowledge of the underlying mapping language nor the used technologies is required. The rmle ditor aims to facilitate the editing of mappings, and thereby lowers the barriers to create Linked Data. The rmle ditor is developed for use by data specialists who are partners of (i) a companies-driven pilot and (ii) a community group. The current version of the rmle ditor was validated: participants indicate that it is adequate for its purpose and the graph-based approach enables users to conceive the linked nature of the data.",Dentro do Escopo,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-34129-3_43.pdf?pdf=inline%20link

Most similarity approaches operate on word-distribution-based document representations - fast to compute, but problematic when documents differ in language, vocabulary or type, and neglecting the rich relational knowledge available in Knowledge Graphs. In contrast, graph-based document models can leverage valuable knowledge about relations between entities - however, due to expensive graph operations, similarity assessments tend to become infeasible in many applications. This paper presents an efficient semantic similarity approach exploiting explicit hierarchical and transversal relations. We show in our experiments that (i) our similarity measure provides a significantly higher correlation with human notions of document similarity than comparable measures, (ii) this also holds for short documents with few annotations, (iii) document similarity can be calculated efficiently compared to other graph-traversal based approaches.",Dentro do Escopo,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-34129-3_21.pdf?pdf=inline%20link

Graph databases have recently emerged within the NoSQL framework and are implemented in systems like Neo4J, OrientDB, etc. Recent works have shown that the management of history is crucial in such systems. In this paper, we show how such historical graph databases can be queried in order to retrieve fraud rings, also known as fraud cycles. Frauds are indeed often based on sophisticated chains of successive transactions (money, communications, etc.). We thus claim that the indirect link between fraudsters can be retrieved by considering historical NoSQL graph databases.

On the other hand, relationships between objects are more and more managed through NoSQL graph databases which use the property graph model to structure information. Such databases provide indeed very efficient tools for handling huge volumes of complex data. They are especially powerful for retrieving relationships between objects (as for instance the famous friend of friend query).

However, PubMed has some drawbacks that make it difficult to find relevant publications pertaining to users' individual intentions, especially for non-expert users. To ameliorate the disadvantages of PubMed, we developed G-Bean, a g raph based b iomedical s ea rch e n gine, to search biomedical articles in MEDLINE database more efficiently. Methods G-Bean addresses PubMed's limitations with three innovations: (1) Parallel document index creation : a multithreaded index creation strategy is employed to generate the document index for G-Bean in parallel; (2) Ontology-graph based query expansion : an ontology graph is constructed by merging four major UMLS (Version 2013AA) vocabularies, MeSH, SNOMEDCT, CSP and AOD, to cover all concepts in National Library of Medicine (NLM) database; a Personalized PageRank algorithm is used to compute concept relevance in this ontology graph and the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency ( TF-IDF ) weighting scheme is used to re-rank the concepts. The top 500 ranked concepts are selected for expanding the initial query to retrieve more accurate and relevant information; (3) Retrieval and re-ranking of documents based on user's search intention : after the user selects any article from the existing search results, G-Bean analyzes user's selections to determine his/her true search intention and then uses more relevant and more specific terms to retrieve additional related articles. The new articles are presented to the user in the order of their relevance to the already selected articles. Results Performance evaluation with 106 OHSUMED benchmark queries shows that G-Bean returns more relevant results than PubMed does when using these queries to search the MEDLINE database. PubMed could not even return any search result for some OHSUMED queries because it failed to form the appropriate Boolean query statement automatically from the natural language query strings. G-Bean is available at http://bioinformatics.clemson.edu/G-Bean/index.php .

Cliques were identified from frequently occurring predications with highly connected arguments filtered by degree centrality.

The validity of the clusters in the summaries produced was compared to the Silhouette-generated baseline for cohesion, separation and overall validity. The theme labels were also compared to a reference standard produced with major MeSH headings. Conclusions For 11 topics in the testing data set, the overall validity of clusters from the system summary was 10% better than the baseline (43% versus 33%).

On semantic data, supervised approaches, particularly kernel-based Support Vector Machines (SVM), are promising. However, obtaining the right features to be used in kernels is an open problem because the amount of features that can be extracted from the complex structure of semantic data might be very large. Further, combining several kernels can help to deal with efficiency and data sparsity but creates the additional challenge of identifying and joining different subsets of features or kernels, respectively. In this work, we solve these two problems by employing the strategy of dynamic feature construction to compute a hypothesis, representing the relevant features for a set of examples. Then, a composite kernel is obtained from a set of clause kernels derived from components of the hypothesis. The learning of the hypothesis and kernel(s) is performed in an interleaving fashion.

For instance, the recent DBpedia version consists of nearly 500 millions triples. A common strategy to avoid problems that arise e.g., from limited network connectivity or lack of bandwidth is to replicate data locally, therefore making them accessible for applications without depending on a network connection. For mobile devices with limited capabilities, however, the replication and synchronization of billions of triples is not feasible. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach to replicate parts of an RDF graph to a client. Applications may then apply changes to this partial replica while being offline; these changes are written back to the original data source upon reconnection. Our approach does not require any kind of additional logic (e.g., change logging) or data structures on the client side, and hence is suitable to be applied on devices with limited computing power and storage capacity.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

We propose a graph kernel based approach for this task. In contrast to earlier approaches to PPI extraction, the introduced all-paths graph kernel has the capability to make use of full, general dependency graphs representing the sentence structure. Results We evaluate the proposed method on five publicly available PPI corpora, providing the most comprehensive evaluation done for a machine learning based PPI-extraction system. We additionally perform a detailed evaluation of the effects of training and testing on different resources, providing insight into the challenges involved in applying a system beyond the data it was trained on. Our method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance with respect to comparable evaluations, with 56.4 F-score and 84.8 AUC on the AImed corpus. Conclusion We show that the graph kernel approach performs on state-of-the-art level in PPI extraction, and note the possible extension to the task of extracting complex interactions. Cross-corpus results provide further insight into how the learning generalizes beyond individual corpora. Further, we identify several pitfalls that can make evaluations of PPI-extraction systems incomparable, or even invalid. These include incorrect cross-validation strategies and problems related to comparing F-score results achieved on different evaluation resources.

These graphs can be constructed from heterogeneous data coming from genomic and post-genomic technologies, but there is still need for tools aiming at exploring and analysing such graphs. This paper describes GenoLink, a software platform for the graphical querying and exploration of graphs. Results GenoLink provides a generic framework for representing and querying data graphs. This framework provides a graph data structure, a graph query engine, allowing to retrieve sub-graphs from the entire data graph, and several graphical interfaces to express such queries and to further explore their results. A query consists in a graph pattern with constraints attached to the vertices and edges. A query result is the set of all sub-graphs of the entire data graph that are isomorphic to the pattern and satisfy the constraints. The graph data structure does not rely upon any particular data model but can dynamically accommodate for any user-supplied data model. However, for genomic and post-genomic applications, we provide a default data model and several parsers for the most popular data sources. GenoLink does not require any programming skill since all operations on graphs and the analysis of the results can be carried out graphically through several dedicated graphical interfaces. Conclusion GenoLink is a generic and interactive tool allowing biologists to graphically explore various sources of information. GenoLink is distributed either as a standalone application or as a component of the Genostar/Iogma platform.

Various computational models have been proposed for this challenge. Most of them assume the annotations of annotated proteins are complete. But in fact, many of them are incomplete. We proposed a method called NewGOA to predict new Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for incompletely annotated proteins and for completely un-annotated ones. NewGOA employs a hybrid graph, composed of two types of nodes (proteins and GO terms), to encode interactions between proteins, hierarchical relationships between terms and available annotations of proteins. To account for structural difference between GO terms subgraph and proteins subgraph, NewGOA applies a bi-random walks algorithm, which executes asynchronous random walks on the hybrid graph, to predict new GO annotations of proteins. Experimental study on archived GO annotations of two model species (H. Sapiens and S. cerevisiae) shows that NewGOA can more accurately and efficiently predict new annotations of proteins than other related methods. Experimental results also indicate the bi-random walks can explore and further exploit the structural difference between GO terms subgraph and proteins subgraph.

A key facet of realizing trust in AI is how to make such systems accountable - a challenging task, not least due to the lack of an agreed definition of accountability and differing perspectives on what information should be recorded and how it should be used (e.g., to inform audit). Information originates across the life cycle stages of an AI system and from a variety of sources (individuals, organizations, systems), raising numerous challenges around collection, management, and audit. In our previous work, we argued that semantic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are ideally suited to address those challenges and we presented an approach utilizing KGs to aid in the tasks of modelling, recording, viewing, and auditing accountability information related to the design stage of AI system development. Moreover, as KGs store data in a structured format understandable by both humans and machines, we argued that this approach provides new opportunities for building intelligent applications that facilitate and automate such tasks. In this paper, we expand our earlier work by reporting additional detailed requirements for knowledge representation and capture in the context of AI accountability; these extend the scope of our work beyond the design stage, to also include system implementation. Furthermore, we present the RAInS ontology which has been extended to satisfy these requirements.

The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a commonly used distributional term clustering technique in this regard. However, existing distributional term clustering approaches have not utilized LDA as a bottom-up training strategy with prior knowledge to cluster semantically related terms as concepts across different domains for building and enhancing a GSCKG. We propose to employ a Twice-Trained Agglomerative hierarchical framework using LDA over Generic Semantic Core KG (T2AggLDA-GSCKG), outlined in five steps. We aim to align term topics with the predefined Core Concepts (CCs) of SCKGs, thereby designating modules of a GSCKG that facilitate both its building and enrichment. Our goal is to adapt the LDA term clustering process by utilizing a topic seed-based LDA model to consider these CCs. During the 1st LDA training, we endeavor to identify hypernym and related relations among noun phrase patterns to construct SCKG, and during the 2nd training, we aim to enhance it. To achieve this, we will boost the 2nd training LDA input data by benefiting from CCs’ two prior knowledge techniques for topic-seed terms incorporation namely seed key knowledge injection and entity masking. The evaluation results show that our proposal has an overwhelming term clustering performance over CCs. It outperforms other unsupervised and semi-supervised distributional baselines on two datasets related to fish hunting and ontology domains, with nearly 13 times higher precision compared to that of normal LDA training.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.1109/INISTA59065.2023.10310336

Leveraging semantic technologies capabilities, this research focused on contextual modelling for social media data, with Twitter data utilised as case study. The raw data is aggregated, processed and transformed into a semantic knowledge graph based on RDF data which is subsequently stored within a graph database. With the tweets initially classified as either fake or real using Fakenewsnet application, the knowledge graph facilitates advanced data analytics and potential extension to the social context modelling developed.

Inspired by the agricultural grafting technology to fruit variety, this paper proposes a heuristic knowledge grafting strategy (HGS) for manufacturing knowledge graph (MKG) named KnowTree extending and completion with natural language processing (NLP) mining engineering cases document. Based on similarity analysis, firstly the grafting related definitions and mechanisms (completeness, relatedness, connectivity and reutilization) are defined. Then, focused on the four mechanisms, HGS takes a pair same engineering documents as input. KnowWords is built as a collection of KnowScion, and each scion is mined from engineering documents based on the SAO structure network, whose importance is evaluated by SAORank counting the in-out degree of centrality. On another hand, the KnowRoot system is designed based on the extended P & S ontology model to characterize the structure of abstract document into four sub-space of knowledge: know-what (problem), know-why (context), know-how (solution) and know-with (result), where a pre-trained language representation model K-BERT is used to classify the KnowScion candidates into the designed KnowRoot system with a fine-tuning classification task. In the knowledge grafting process, the connection unit is constructed based on the extracted domain knowledge triples of the K-BERT model, where the head element of a triple is from the KnowScion candidate set KnowWords satisfying the threshold value, the tail element is from the domain MKG to be extended, and a connection factor is used to evaluate the relationship of union combination. To the goal of knowledge reuse, the path based reasoning rules are designed for KnowTree reutilization. Finally, take the latest engineering case abstract (ECA) in whitegoods domain as resources, a case study is conducted to validate the proposed HGS strategy.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3092019

Many of the decision making will need an optimization core for determining the optimum assignment for the control variables. This needs to be on-line to take care of the dynamics of the network and user contexts with strict time budgets. Moreover the overall network system is highly non-linear and often the state relations are analytically not tractable. An efficient search algorithm using a system model incorporating aspects of system ontology is be of value. Here a signed graph based methodology is proposed to incorporate the knowledge of influence relationship between state variables to guide a heuristic optimization process.

However, the practice of MK reuse and research is fragmented and insufficient, which cannot be mature to provide a systemic solution for that a decision-maker has to consider the involving issues: how MK can be used earlier and rightly; what kind of practical problems can be solved? In order to answer those interconnecting issues, this paper firstly proposes a connectivism framework to clarify the compressive relationship of problem-to-problem, knowledge-to-knowledge and problem-to-knowledge with knowledge integration, knowledge matching, and problem-solving layers. Then, based on the framework, an ontology-based MK graph (MKG) is constructed with a unified MK-filter to collect and integrate multifactor and multilevel MK, and a graph-oriented meta-knowledge model (MKM) is proposed to represent the details between the knowledge entities (i.e., concept and instance), which also shows the contribution to knowledge reasoning. After that, driven by a structure temporal query (i.e., 5W2H), a semantics-based knowledge computation is developed to compute the intrinsic term similarity (IS) and relational term similarity (RS) between two knowledge entities in the MKG.

This paper proposes a framework for KG generation for criminology as a prospective domain of choice. The proposed model uses two distinct deep learning classifiers namely the Transformers and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to classify the dataset and the generated metadata respectively. A static upper domain ontology is also made use of as a reference ontology to aggregate and grow the knowledge base. Knowledge and instance aggregation is achieved using Wikidata and Moki as standard prospective knowledge stores along with the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based topic modelling. This framework also generates the ontologies dynamically using OntoColab and the alignment of static and dynamic ontologies is achieve using the Lin Similarity measure with a specified threshold. The encompassment of entities from a News API knowledge stack, which integrates five different news APIs, helps in further enrichment of entities as well as instances. The Second Order Cooccurrence Pointwise Mutual Information (SOC-PMI) measure with the Goodall Index with variation in thresholds and differential step deviance measures ensures relevant information filtering and the Fish School Search with APMI helps in instance alignment along with the optimization of the feasible solution set to a much more optimal solution set to formulate the finalized highly relevant KG.

The main objective is to offer a platform that discovers drug combinations from FDA-approved drugs and accelerates their investigations by domain scientists. Specifically, the paper introduced the following algorithms: (1) an algorithm for constructing the knowledge graph from drug, gene, and disease mentions in the biomedical literature; (2) an algorithm for vetting the knowledge graph from drug combinations that may pose a risk of drug interaction; (3) and two querying algorithms for searching the knowledge graph by a single drug or a combination of drugs. The resulting knowledge graph had 844 drugs, 306 gene/protein features, and 19 disease mentions. The original number of drug combinations generated was 2,001. We queried the knowledge graph to eliminate noise generated from chemicals that are not drugs. This step resulted in 614 drug combinations. When vetting the knowledge graph to eliminate the potentially risky drug combinations, it resulted in predicting 200 combinations. Our domain expert manually eliminated extra 54 combinations which left only 146 combination candidates.

To reduce human effort to build a taxonomy from scratch and improve the quality of the learned taxonomy, we propose a new taxonomy learning approach, named TaxoFinder. TaxoFinder takes three steps to automatically build a taxonomy. First, it identifies domain-specific concepts from a domain text corpus. Second, it builds a graph representing how such concepts are associated together based on their co-occurrences. As the key method in TaxoFinder, we propose a method for measuring associative strengths among the concepts, which quantify how strongly they are associated in the graph, using similarities between sentences and spatial distances between sentences. Lastly, TaxoFinder induces a taxonomy from the graph using a graph analytic algorithm. TaxoFinder aims to build a taxonomy in such a way that it maximizes the overall associative strengths among the concepts in the graph to build a taxonomy. We evaluate TaxoFinder using gold-standard evaluation on three different domains: emergency management for mass gatherings, autism research, and disease domains. In our evaluation, we compare TaxoFinder with a state-of-the-art subsumption method and show that TaxoFinder is an effective approach significantly outperforming the subsumption method.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.1109/TKDE.2015.2475759

The objective of this work is to offer insights into OF clustering from the aspects of graph neural networks and diagnosis history. Methods: This paper proposes a neural network-based pipeline to cluster three types of organ failure patients by incorporating embedding pre-train using an ontology graph of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We employ an autoencoder-based deep clustering architecture jointly trained with a K-means loss, and a non-linear dimension reduction is performed to obtain patient clusters on the MIMIC-III dataset. Results: The clustering pipeline shows superior performance on a public-domain image dataset. On the MIMIC-III dataset, it discovers two distinct clusters that exhibit different comorbidity spectra which can be related to the severity of diseases. The proposed pipeline is compared with several other clustering models and shows superiority. Conclusion: Our proposed pipeline gives stable clusters, however, they do not correspond to the type of OF which indicates these OF share significant hidden characteristics in diagnosis.

Identifying multidimensional regulatory modules (md-modules) from omics data is crucial to provide a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of biological systems. Methods: We develop a multi-graph matching with multiple network constraints (MGMMNC) model to identify the md-modules. The MGMMNC model aims to accurately capture highly relevant md-modules by considering the relationships intra- and inter-multidimensional omics data, including interactions within a network and cycle consistency information. The proposed technique adopts a novel graph-smoothing similarity measurement for the highly contaminated genetic data. Results: The superiority and effectiveness of MGMMNC have been demonstrated by comparative experiments with three state-of-the-art techniques using simulated and cervical cancer data. Conclusion: MGMMNC can accurately and efficiently identify the md-modules that are significantly enriched in gene ontology biological processes and in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Many different level molecules in the same md-module collaboratively regulate the same pathway. Moreover, the md-modules are capable of stratifying patients into subtypes with significant survival differences.

10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004143,Journals,March 2021,Disease Prediction via Graph Neural Networks,"With the increasingly available electronic medical records (EMRs), disease prediction has recently gained immense research attention, where an accurate classifier needs to be trained to map the input prediction signals (e.g., symptoms, patient demographics, etc.) to the estimated diseases for each patient. However, existing machine learning-based solutions heavily rely on abundant manually labeled EMR training data to ensure satisfactory prediction results, impeding their performance in the existence of rare diseases that are subject to severe data scarcity. For each rare disease, the limited EMR data can hardly offer sufficient information for a model to correctly distinguish its identity from other diseases with similar clinical symptoms. Furthermore, most existing disease prediction approaches are based on the sequential EMRs collected for every patient and are unable to handle new patients without historical EMRs, reducing their real-life practicality. In this paper, we introduce an innovative model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for disease prediction, which utilizes external knowledge bases to augment the insufficient EMR data, and learns highly representative node embeddings for patients, diseases and symptoms from the medical concept graph and patient record graph respectively constructed from the medical knowledge base and EMRs. By aggregating information from directly connected neighbor nodes, the proposed neural graph encoder can effectively generate embeddings that capture knowledge from both data sources, and is able to inductively infer the embeddings for a new patient based on the symptoms reported in her/his EMRs to allow for accurate prediction on both general diseases and rare diseases.

The interaction and communication among these things generate an enormous amount of context-aware data that is semantically diverse. Traditional data representation approaches, such as semantic annotation, ontology, and semantic Web technology are rule based, which lack flexibility and adaptability when applied to IoT. To address the challenge, this article mainly focuses on the problem of semantic representation, which is essential for processing and fusion of IoT data. To serve as a bridge, we propose a high-level framework, namely, Things2Vec, which aims to produce the latent semantic representations from the interaction of things through the graph embedding technique. These semantic representations benefit various IoT semantic analysis tasks, such as the IoT service recommendation and automation of things. In Things2Vec, we utilize the graph to model the function sequence relationships that are generated by the interaction of things, which is called the IoT context graph. Since these function sequence relationships are heterogeneous in terms of semantics, it causes general graph embeddings to fail to learn complete information. Thus, we propose a biased random walk procedure, which is tailored to capture the neighborhoods of nodes with different types of semantic relationships. Extensive experiments are carried out, and our results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the semantic relationships among context-aware data in IoT.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

A knowledge graph (KG) has recently been proposed to manage massive and unorganized maintenance data semantically, enhancing data usage. Despite the fact that previous research had utilized KG for maintenance planning, they had only used semantic searching or graph structure-based algorithms and had not included the prediction of new links. To fill this gap, a maintenance-oriented KG is established firstly based on the well-defined ontology schema and accumulated maintenance data. Then, an Attention-Based Compressed Relational Graph Convolutional Network is proposed to find the potential solutions and explain the fault, specifically for the heterogeneous and sparse graph structure of maintenance-orient KG. A maintenance case of oil drilling equipment is carried out, which compares the proposed model with other cutting-edge models to demonstrate its effectiveness in link prediction.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.1109/ICRMS55680.2022.9944561
10.1109/JBHI.2023.3286917,Early Access Articles,,Prediction of LncRNA-Protein Interactions Based on Kernel Combinations and Graph Convolutional Networks,"The complexes of long non-coding RNAs bound to proteins can be involved in regulating life activities at various stages of organisms. However, in the face of the growing number of lncRNAs and proteins, verifying LncRNA-Protein Interactions (LPI) based on traditional biological experiments is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, with the improvement of computing power, predicting LPI has met new development opportunity. In virtue of the state-of-the-art works, a framework called LncRNA-Protein Interactions based on Kernel Combinations and Graph Convolutional Networks (LPI-KCGCN) has been proposed in this article. We first construct kernel matrices by taking advantage of extracting both the lncRNAs and protein concerning the sequence features, sequence similarity features, expression features, and gene ontology. Then reconstruct the existent kernel matrices as the input of the next step. Combined with known LPI interactions, the generated similarity matrices, which can be used as features of the topology map of the LPI network, are exploited in extracting potential representations in the lncRNA and protein space using a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network. The predicted matrix can be finally obtained by training the network to produce scoring matrices w.r.t. lncRNAs and proteins. Different LPI-KCGCN variants are ensemble to derive the final prediction results and testify on balanced and unbalanced datasets. The 5-fold cross-validation shows that the optimal feature information combination on a dataset with $15.5\%$ positive samples has an AUC value of 0.9714 and an AUPR value of 0.9216. On another highly unbalanced dataset with only $5\%$ positive samples, LPI-KCGCN also has outperformed the state-of-the-art works, which achieved an AUC value of 0.9907 and an AUPR value of 0.9267.

10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3177463,Journals,2022,Boosting Climate Analysis With Semantically Uplifted Knowledge Graphs,"Nowadays, the fast expansion of heterogeneous climate data resources accessible on the Internet has led to substantial data fragmentation on the web. For example, station-based sensor data from different sources are likely to be interrelated but may be stored in disparate formats, such as CSV, JSON, and XML. To address the data isolation problem, several semantically uplifted knowledge graphs are proposed for climate data exchange. While these knowledge graphs improve data interoperability, the advancement in multisource data interchange is limited to data included inside knowledge graphs. As a result, the exclusive interoperability of current climatic knowledge graphs hampers the flow of data into typical climate analysis workflows in contexts, where analytical models often need data in nonknowledge graph formats. This article addresses this issue by focusing on enhancing climate analysis workflows within the context of the Python machine learning environment, with a preference for tabular data. We propose an analysis workflow able to automatically integrate remote climate knowledge graph data with local tabular data so as to enhance the data usability with respect to certain climate analysis tasks. To underscore the importance of our study, we illustrate how the workflow streamlines the access to multisource climatic variables in the Python environment from a semantic perspective. The additional knowledge graph data have the potential to augment local datasets in the climate domain, as evidenced by an improvement in accuracy of up to 10% for machine learning geared on rainfall detection.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

On top of the proposed architecture, we developed AIDA-Bot, a simple chatbot that leverages a large-scale knowledge graph of scholarly data. AIDA-Bot can answer natural language questions about scientific articles, research concepts, researchers, institutions, and research venues.

Most studies on cyber threat intelligence (CTI) focus on automating the extraction of threat entities from public sources that describe attack events. The cybersecurity knowledge graph aims to change the expression of threat knowledge so that security researchers can accurately and efﬁciently obtain various types of threat information for preliminary intelligent decisions. The attribution technology can not only assist security analysts in detecting advanced persistent threats, but can also identify the same threat from different attack events. Therefore, it is important to trace the attack threat actor. In this study, we used the knowledge graph technology, considered the latest research on cyber threat attack attribution, and thoroughly examined key related technologies and theories in the process of constructing and applying the advanced persistent threat (APT) knowledge graph from OSCTI. We designed a cybersecurity platform named CSKG4APT based on a knowledge graph. Inspired by the theory of ontology, we constructed CSKG4APT as an APT knowledge graph model based on real APT attack scenarios. We then designed an APT threat knowledge extraction algorithm for completing and updating the knowledge graph using deep learning and expert knowledge. Finally, we proposed a practical APT attack attribution method with attribution and countermeasures. CSKG4APT is not a passive defense method in traditional network confrontation but one that integrates a large amount of fragmented intelligence and can actively adjust its defense strategy. It lays the foundation for further dominance in network attack and defense.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

It is applicable in the process of writing programs as it helps users to understand their codes better.

These environments generate data streams that could be represented as graphs, which can be analysed in real-time to satisfy user or application needs. The challenges involved in these environments, ranging from the dynamism, heterogeneity, continuity, and high-volume of these real-world graph streams
create new requirements for graph processing algorithms. We propose
a dynamic graph stream summarisation system with the use of embeddings that provides expressive graphs while ensuring high usability and limited resource usage. In this paper, we examine the performance comparison between our embeddings-based approach and an existing thesaurus/ontology-based approach (FACES) that we adapted in a dynamic environment with the use of windows and data fusion. Both
approaches use conceptual clustering and top-k scoring that can result
in expressive, dynamic graph summaries with limited resources. Evaluations show that sending top-k fused diverse summaries, results in 34%
to 92% reduction of forwarded messages and redundancy-awareness with
an F-score ranging from 0.80 to 0.95 depending on the k compared to
sending all the available information without top-k scoring. Also, the
summaries' quality follows the agreement of ideal summaries determined
by human judges. The summarisation approaches come with the expense
of reduced system performance. The thesaurus/ontology-based approach
proved 6 times more latency-heavy and 3 times more memory-heavy compared to the most expensive embeddings-based approach while having
lower throughput but provided slightly better quality summaries.",Dentro do Escopo,Link para PDF não encontrado.

From a know­ledge fusion perspective-combining the precise semantic superiority of traditional ontology with the large-scale graph processing power and the predicate attribute expression ability of property graph-this paper presents an ontology and property graph fusion framework (OPGFF). The fusion process is divided into content layer fusion and constraint layer fusion. The result of the fusion, that is, the know­ledge representation model is called know­ledge big graph. In addition, this paper applies the know­ledge big graph model to the ownership network in the China’s financial field and builds a financial ownership know­ledge big graph. Furthermore, this paper designs and implements six consistency inference algorithms for finding contradictory data and filling in missing data in the financial ownership know­ledge big graph, five of which are completely domain agnostic. The correctness and validity of the algorithms have been experimentally verified with actual data.

               Summary: A standard systems-based approach to biomarker and drug target discovery consists of placing putative biomarkers in the context of a network of biological interactions, followed by different ‘guilt-by-association’ analyses. The latter is typically done based on network structural features. Here, an alternative analysis approach in which the networks are analyzed on a ‘semantic similarity’ space is reported. Such information is extracted from ontology-based functional annotations. We present SimTrek, a Cytoscape plugin for ontology-based similarity assessment in biological networks.

                        &lt;p&gt;Ontology is a core concept model in a knowledge graph which describes knowledge in the form of a graph. With the increase in knowledge graphs, the semantic relationships between concepts become more and more complex, which increases the difficulty of reserving its semantic integrity when storing it in a database. In this paper, we propose an ontology-to-graph database mapping method, which can reserve maximum semantic integrity and reduce redundant information simultaneously with high storage efficiency and query efficiency. In detail, the mapping method uses an anonymous class storage strategy to handle indefinite long nested structures, a multivariate functional relation storage strategy for multivariate semantic analysis, and an SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) storage strategy for disassembling inference structures. We develop an ontology-to-graph database prototype Neo4J4Onto to implement the mapping method. Experimental results show that our method achieves the maximum semantic integrity with the lowest complexity compared to the 6 baseline methods. Besides, compared to graphDB, Neo4J4Onto has better storage and query efficiency, and the concept models retrieved by Neo4J4Onto are more complete.&lt;/p&gt;

               Motivation: Current methods for multiplicity adjustment do not make use of the graph structure of Gene Ontology (GO) when testing for association of expression profiles of GO terms with a response variable.
               Results: We propose a multiple testing method, called the focus level procedure, that preserves the graph structure of Gene Ontology (GO). The procedure is constructed as a combination of a Closed Testing procedure with Holm's method. It requires a user to choose a ‘focus level’ in the GO graph, which reflects the level of specificity of terms in which the user is most interested. This choice also determines the level in the GO graph at which the procedure has most power. We prove that the procedure strongly controls the family-wise error rate without any additional assumptions on the joint distribution of the test statistics used. We also present an algorithm to calculate multiplicity-adjusted P-values. Because the focus level procedure preserves the structure of the GO graph, it does not generally preserve the ordering of the raw P-values in the adjusted P-values.
               Availability: The focus level procedure has been implemented in the globaltest and GlobalAncova packages, both of which are available on www.bioconductor.org.

            The Gene Ontology is a controlled vocabulary for representing knowledge related to genes and proteins in a computable form. The current effort of manually annotating proteins with the Gene Ontology is outpaced by the rate of accumulation of biomedical knowledge in literature, which urges the development of text mining approaches to facilitate the process by automatically extracting the Gene Ontology annotation from literature. The task is usually cast as a text classification problem, and contemporary methods are confronted with unbalanced training data and the difficulties associated with multi-label classification.

            In this research, we investigated the methods of enhancing automatic multi-label classification of biomedical literature by utilizing the structure of the Gene Ontology graph. We have studied three graph-based multi-label classification algorithms, including a novel stochastic algorithm and two top-down hierarchical classification methods for multi-label literature classification. We systematically evaluated and compared these graph-based classification algorithms to a conventional flat multi-label algorithm. The results indicate that, through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods can significantly improve predictions of the Gene Ontology terms implied by the analyzed text. Furthermore, the graph-based multi-label classifiers are capable of suggesting Gene Ontology annotations (to curators) that are closely related to the true annotations even if they fail to predict the true ones directly. A software package implementing the studied algorithms is available for the research community.

An Irish Experiment,"<p>Domains represent concepts which belong to specific parts of the world. The particularized meaning of words linguistically encoding such domain concepts are provided by domain specific resources. The explicit meaning of such words are increasingly captured computationally using domain-specific ontologies, which, even for the same reference domain, are most often than not semantically incompatible. As information systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, there is a growing need to not only design domain ontologies and domain ontology-grounded Knowl­edge Graphs (KGs) but also to align them to general standards and conventions for interoperability. This often presents an insurmountable challenge to domain experts who have to additionally learn the construction of domain ontologies and KGs. Until now, several research methodologies have been proposed by different research groups using different technical approaches and based on scenarios of different domains of application. However, no methodology has been proposed which not only facilitates designing conceptually well-founded ontologies, but is also, equally, grounded in the general pedagogical principles of knowl­edge organization and, thereby, flexible enough to teach, and reproduce vis-à-vis domain experts.

The purpose of domain-specific ontology is to enrich the identification of concept and the interrelationships. In our research, we use ontology to specify a set of generic subjects (concept) that characterizes the domain as well as their definitions and interrelationships. This paper introduces a system for labeling subjects of a text documents based on the differential layers of domain specific ontology, which contains the information and the vocabularies related to the computer domain. A document can contain several subjects such as data science, database, and machine learning. The subjects in text document classification are determined based on the differential layers of the domain specific ontology. We combine the methodologies of Natural Language Processing with domain ontology to determine the subjects in text document. In order to increase performance, we use graph database to store and access ontology. Besides, the paper focuses on evaluating our proposed algorithm with some other methods. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm yields performance significantly",Dentro do Escopo,

               Motivation: Systematically predicting gene (or protein) function based on molecular interaction networks has become an important tool in refining and enhancing the existing annotation catalogs, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) database. However, functional labels with only a few (&amp;lt;10) annotated genes, which constitute about half of the GO terms in yeast, mouse and human, pose a unique challenge in that any prediction algorithm that independently considers each label faces a paucity of information and thus is prone to capture non-generalizable patterns in the data, resulting in poor predictive performance. There exist a variety of algorithms for function prediction, but none properly address this ‘overfitting’ issue of sparsely annotated functions, or do so in a manner scalable to tens of thousands of functions in the human catalog.
               Results: We propose a novel function prediction algorithm, clusDCA, which transfers information between similar functional labels to alleviate the overfitting problem for sparsely annotated functions. Our method is scalable to datasets with a large number of annotations. In a cross-validation experiment in yeast, mouse and human, our method greatly outperformed previous state-of-the-art function prediction algorithms in predicting sparsely annotated functions, without sacrificing the performance on labels with sufficient information. Furthermore, we show that our method can accurately predict genes that will be assigned a functional label that has no known annotations, based only on the ontology graph structure and genes associated with other labels, which further suggests that our method effectively utilizes the similarity between gene functions.

This study proposes a novel method for efficiently learning frequent subgraphs (i.e., knowledge) from ontology-based graph data. An ontology-based large-scale graph is decomposed into small unit subgraphs, which are used as the unit to calculate the frequency of the subgraph. The frequent subgraphs are extracted through candidate generation and chunking processes. To verify the usefulness of the extracted frequent subgraphs, the methodology was applied to movie rating prediction. Using the frequent subgraphs as user profiles, the graph similarity between the rating graph and new item graph was calculated to predict the rating. The MovieLens dataset was used for the experiment, and a comparison showed that the proposed method outperformed other widely used recommendation methods. This study is meaningful in that it proposed an efficient method for extracting frequent subgraphs while maintaining semantic information and considering scalability in large-scale graphs. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide results that include semantic information to serve as a logical basis for rating prediction or recommendation, which existing methods are unable to provide.",Dentro do Escopo,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/3/932/pdf?version=1611566327

Ontology is traditionally considered as a means of studying and formalizing the subject area. Based on ontologies, knowledge bases of information systems are formed, which can later be replenished and used to study certain applied aspects of the subject area. At the same time, with the development of NoSQL technologies and graph databases aimed at optimizing work with related data, it becomes possible to design a data warehouse without a strict pre-established domain model. Due to the obvious graph nature of ontologies, graph databases are a promising solution for storing and working with ontologies. However, with all the similarities, the ontology and data models used in graph DBMSs are not so easy to combine. The paper proposes an approach to the integration of ontological and graph models of knowledge representation and considers its application in creating a database for a prototype of a web ontology editor. Visual tools for editing ontologies are described, an algorithm for layer-by-layer rendering of a directed graph is given, a mechanism for generating dynamic forms for editing classes and ontology instances is described, and basic support for ontological design patterns is implemented.",Dentro do Escopo,Link para PDF não encontrado.

            The Gene Ontology has become an extremely useful tool for the analysis of genomic data and structuring of biological knowledge. Several excellent software tools for navigating the gene ontology have been developed. However, no existing system provides an interactively expandable graph-based view of the gene ontology hierarchy. Furthermore, most existing tools are web-based or require an Internet connection, will not load local annotations files, and provide either analysis or visualization functionality, but not both.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            To address the above limitations, we have developed GOLEM (Gene Ontology Local Exploration Map), a visualization and analysis tool for focused exploration of the gene ontology graph. GOLEM allows the user to dynamically expand and focus the local graph structure of the gene ontology hierarchy in the neighborhood of any chosen term. It also supports rapid analysis of an input list of genes to find enriched gene ontology terms. The GOLEM application permits the user either to utilize local gene ontology and annotations files in the absence of an Internet connection, or to access the most recent ontology and annotation information from the gene ontology webpage. GOLEM supports global and organism-specific searches by gene ontology term name, gene ontology id and gene name.

The development of approaches that identify potentially spurious parts of a given knowledge base is therefore highly relevant.

By systematically evaluating thirteen methods (some for knowledge graphs) on eight different semantic resources, including Gene Ontology, Food Ontology, Marine Ontology, and similar ontologies, we demonstrate that a structure-only link analysis can offer a scalable and computationally efficient ontology completion approach for a subset of analyzed data sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the most extensive systematic study of the applicability of different types of link analysis methods across semantic resources from different domains.

This dependency leads to some limitations in real applications. Here, we present a semantic similarity algorithm (SSA), that relies exclusively on the GO. When calculating the semantic similarity between a pair of input GO terms, SSA takes into account the shortest path between them, the depth of their nearest common ancestor, and a novel similarity score calculated between the definitions of the involved GO terms. In our work, we use SSA to calculate semantic similarities between pairs of proteins by combining pairwise semantic similarities between the GO terms that annotate the involved proteins. The reliability of SSA was evaluated by comparing the resulting semantic similarities between proteins with the functional similarities between proteins derived from expert annotations or sequence similarity. Comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods showed that SSA is highly competitive with the other methods. SSA provides a reliable measure for semantics similarity independent of external databases of functional-annotation observations.

Establishing a unifying data model is recognized as a cornerstone to such solutions.

While already existing ISOagriNET Data Dictionaries capture broad variety of the livestock and dairy farming concepts, the existing model representation technics cannot support efficient model extension. In this paper, we present our experience with using the representation and query standards and tools of the Semantic Web, endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), in particular the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and the SPARQL query standard, to encode and manipulate the dairy farming domain knowledge in a form of the Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO). Within the research project agriOpenLink the DFO has been created in two phases. The first phase focused on using the Semantic Web tools to facilitate easy encoding and manipulation of the dairy farming domain knowledge and the platform operational data models. The second phase focused on translating ISOagriNET Data Dictionaries into their semantic representations. Resulting DFO is maintained in a semantic repository, and it presents a knowledge graph and as integration backbone for the agriOpenLink decision support platform.",Dentro do Escopo,
10.1111/exsy.12337,journal-article,2018-10-09,Variable weight semantic graph‐based ontology mapping method,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>The mapping method that is based on the name and structure of the ontology elements is the strategy used in most mapping methods. Methods using the name often only use the similarity between the individual elements in the ontology to predict the semantic relations between two ontologies, while the latter measure the mapping between two ontologies by means of the structural relations between the elements. The effects of these two kinds of mapping strategies are not ideal. Addressing this issue, the work presented in this paper proposes an ontology mapping approach, in which the ontology element name and structure are combined. It uses the approaches based on linguistics and distance to generate a variable weight semantic graph. On this graph, the similarity of element names and structure are calculated through iterative computation. In the process of iteration, similarity result values are constantly adjusted. The approach avoids the problem of single methods that cannot use the entire amount of ontology information; therefore, it provides a more ideal mapping result. For making full use of the message of ontology, our implementation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mapping approach.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.1111/exsy.12337

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                Protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction is an important task towards the understanding of many bioinformatics functions and applications, such as predicting protein functions, gene-disease associations and disease-drug associations. However, many previous PPI prediction researches do not consider missing and spurious interactions inherent in PPI networks. To address these two issues, we define two corresponding tasks, namely missing PPI prediction and spurious PPI prediction, and propose a method that employs graph embeddings that learn vector representations from constructed Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) graphs and then use embedded vectors to achieve the two tasks. Our method leverages on information from both term–term relations among GO terms and term-protein annotations between GO terms and proteins, and preserves properties of both local and global structural information of the GO annotation graph.

A forest is a complex of additional connected trees. The skeleton of the graph is the basic multi-hierarchy. Subjects and “forces” are sources of moves on the playing field of the trans-forest based on the rules of the generative grammars of Montague. Each move of all generative grammars is synchronized with the meta-generative grammar – the “daemon of time”. Each turn over a trans-forest can be done by moving the present marker on the time tree to the “Next” position. Particular attention is paid to the format tree and trans-connections between trees and its levels, since it is the format tree that determines human behavior in certain situations. An algorithm of evolutionarily justified expansions is proposed, the purpose of which is to ensure well-being for the subject himself and other subjects. The proposed trans-forest model is intended for modeling educational, language IT marketing, geological and other situations from the point of view of graph theory and game theory",Dentro do Escopo,https://elib.sfu-kras.ru/bitstream/2311/139971/1/13_Skornyakova.pdf

One of the advantages of component-based design is reusability. To reuse or share DEVS models developed by many other modelers, a system to systematically store and retrieve many DEVS models should be supported. However, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist such a system. In this paper, we propose GO-DEVS (Graph/Ontology-represented DEVS storage and retrieval system) to store and retrieve DEVS models using graph and ontology representation. For effective model sharing, an ontology is introduced when a DEVS model is developed. To search for DEVS models in an effective and efficient way, we propose two types of queries, IO query and structure query, and provide a method to store and query DEVS models on an RDBMS.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btq203,journal-article,2010-06-07,Assessing the functional coherence of gene sets with metrics based on the Gene Ontology graph,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               Motivation: The results of initial analyses for many high-throughput technologies commonly take the form of gene or protein sets, and one of the ensuing tasks is to evaluate the functional coherence of these sets. The study of gene set function most commonly makes use of controlled vocabulary in the form of ontology annotations. For a given gene set, the statistical significance of observing these annotations or ‘enrichment’ may be tested using a number of methods. Instead of testing for significance of individual terms, this study is concerned with the task of assessing the global functional coherence of gene sets, for which novel metrics and statistical methods have been devised.
               Results: The metrics of this study are based on the topological properties of graphs comprised of genes and their Gene Ontology annotations. A novel aspect of these methods is that both the enrichment of annotations and the relationships among annotations are considered when determining the significance of functional coherence. We applied our methods to perform analyses on an existing database and on microarray experimental results. Here, we demonstrated that our approach is highly discriminative in terms of differentiating coherent gene sets from random ones and that it provides biologically sensible evaluations in microarray analysis. We further used examples to show the utility of graph visualization as a tool for studying the functional coherence of gene sets.

However, existing security risk analysis methods for the IoV either focus only on certain levels, such as the component level, or perform only a static analysis. This paper proposes a dynamic attack graph generation method for the IoV to identify and visually display the security risks caused by the associated vulnerabilities in an IoV system. First, using the actual architecture of the IoV, this paper shows how to model the security elements and their relationships in the IoV system and proposes a network security ontology model for this system. Second, it shows how to construct a reasoning rule base according to the causal relationship between the vulnerabilities using the Semantic Web Rule Language Finally, in view of the rapid change in the network topology of the IoV, a dynamic attack graph generation algorithm based on an ontology reasoning engine is proposed, which can effectively reduce the overhead caused by the changes in the attack graph. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an actual security event scenario and a constructed scenario. The experimental results show that the algorithm can dynamically and accurately display the network attack graph of the IoV. The proposed method is helpful in globally analyzing the threat caused by the combined exploitation of the vulnerabilities in an IoV system and risk management.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

However, since the structural and temporal characteristics of medical records are affected by many uncertain factors, there are many limitations in medication recommendation methods based on EHRs. Specifically, most existing works either fail to adequately assess the structural correlation and temporal dependency among various medical entities or ignore existing knowledge of Drug–Drug Interactions (DDI), which could lead to adverse outcomes. These factors contribute to poor recommendation quality. Therefore, we propose a medical ontology tree model combined with the Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for medication recommendations. First, the class hierarchy extracted from the medical ontology and the GAT model is used to learn the ICD-9 codes of diagnoses and procedures, which enriches the semantic representation of medical entities. Secondly, Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) are used to learn the temporal characteristics of medical entities. Finally, memory bank, dynamic memory and DDI graph are used to optimize the hidden layer results, which improve the accuracy of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the previous methods in all evaluation indicators, and the recommended results have a lower DDI rate.",Dentro do Escopo,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/21/3558/pdf?version=1667883867

The ontology provides a formal representation of the concepts that the Arabic terms convey, and its content was built with ontological analysis in mind, and benchmarked to scientific advances and rigorous knowledge sources as much as this is possible, rather than to only speakers’ beliefs as lexicons typically are. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted thereby demonstrating that the current version of the top-levels of the ontology can top the majority of the Arabic meanings. The ontology consists currently of about 1,800 well-investigated concepts in addition to 16,000 concepts that are partially validated. The ontology is accessible and searchable through a lexicographic search engine (http://ontology.birzeit.edu) that also includes about 150 Arabic-multilingual lexicons, and which are being mapped and enriched using the ontology. The ontology is fully mapped with Princeton WordNet, Wikidata, and other resources.",Dentro do Escopo,Link para PDF não encontrado.

               <jats:p />
               Drought disasters have caused serious impacts on the social economy and ecological environment, which are continuously and increasingly exacerbated by climate warming and other factors. Drought disaster management usually involves processing a mass of isolated data from many fields expressed in different terminologies and formats. These heterogeneous data or so-called data silos have greatly hindered drought disaster management in an information-rich manner. Establishing a drought disaster knowledge graph can facilitate the reuse of these heterogeneous data and provide references for drought disaster management, and ontology design and named entity recognition are the two major challenges. Therefore, in this study, we first designed a drought disaster ontology by recognizing the major concepts in the drought disaster field and their relationships, which was implemented with an ontology modeling language. We next constructed a drought disaster corpus and an integrated entity recognition model that was built by integrating multiple deep learning methods. Finally, we applied the integrated entity recognition model to extract information from the CNKI literature database. The integrated model shows satisfactory results in drought disaster named entity recognition. We thus conclude that combining ontology and deep learning technology toward establishing a knowledge graph for drought disasters is promising.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.2166/hydro.2023.046

               Background: The ability to produce timely, clinically actionable recommendations is a cornerstone of a robust precision oncology program. This requires the assimilation of rapidly changing precision oncology data that flows asynchronously from various EMR and lab sources. A key challenge is harmonization of omics biomarkers from hospital-based and commercial testing labs, rendering these omics data interpretable and comparable between patients, labs and reports. To address this challenge, we describe an automated system leveraging a hybrid ontology and graph structure to permit the rapid harmonization and interpretation of molecular diagnostic results across multiple labs.
               Methods: A two-part, fully automated system to ingest and harmonize omics biomarker data from hospital-based and commercial testing labs was developed. First, an ontology-based omics lexicon provides annotation of discrete laboratory values provided electronically. The ontology model is Manchester language-based with data stored in a relational document store. Second, a graph structure serves as the knowledge model and relates the annotated lab values to 12 types of clinically informative biomarkers, including sequence and copy number variants, tumor mutational burden, MSI, gene rearrangements, wild type, and expression biomarkers. The graph structure leverages the ontology to fully describe hierarchical and categorical data associated with each biomarker. Access to the omics knowledge model uses a RESTful API and relational database architecture. Acquisition of molecular data uses custom JSON schemas and a RESTful API.
               Results: Feeds from 7 commercial and hospital-based labs resulted in the receipt of &amp;gt;12,000 molecular diagnostic reports containing &amp;gt;2 million individual biomarker observations, with integration of each report achieved within 2 minutes of electronic data receipt. As of Nov. 2018, 81.2% of reports had at least one biomarker observation, while the remaining reports lacked results. Within these biomarker observations, 95.8% were represented in the ontology/graph structure, resulting in successful linkage to ~22,000 distinct harmonized biomarkers out of more than 12 million in the knowledge base. Of the linked, harmonized variant biomarkers, 4% are class-level (e.g. BRAF mutation) with the remainder reflecting more specificity (e.g. BRAF V600E). Within the set of more specific biomarkers, 54% represent a protein altering variant biomarker.
               Conclusions: We have built an automated, scalable system using a novel ontology/graph structure to reliably and automatically harmonize and integrate omics data into a real-world oncology precision medicine platform. Proof of concept validation has been demonstrated in over 12,000 patient reports, with the results being used to enable clinical trials matching and outcomes research.

10.1177/1474474012462534,journal-article,2012-10-05,Ontology and indigeneity: on the political ontology of heterogeneous assemblages," The first challenge faced by a project that seeks to bring concerns with ontology and indigeneity into a conversation is to sort out the various (and possibly divergent) projects that are being mobilized when the former term is used, not the least because what do we mean by ontology impinges upon how we can conceive indigeneity. In this article I play a counterpoint between two ‘ontological’ projects: one in geography, that foregrounds a reality conceived as an always-emergent assemblage of human and non-humans and troubles the politics that such assemblages imply. The other in ethnographic theory, that foregrounds that we are not only dealing with a shifting ontology, a (re)animated world, but also with multiple ontologies, a multiplicity of worlds animated in different ways. Thus, if the heterogeneity of always emerging assemblages troubles the political, the very heterogeneity of these heterogeneous assemblages troubles it even more. What kinds of politics and what kinds of knowledges does this troubling demand? I advance the notion of political ontology as a possible venue to explore this question.

               Measuring the semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental step in numerous functional bioinformatics applications. To fully exploit the metadata of GO terms, word embedding-based methods have been proposed recently to map GO terms to low-dimensional feature vectors. However, these representation methods commonly overlook the key information hidden in the whole GO structure and the relationship between GO terms. In this paper, we propose a novel representation model for GO terms, named GT2Vec, which jointly considers the GO graph structure obtained by graph contrastive learning and the semantic description of GO terms based on BERT encoders. Our method is evaluated on a protein similarity task on a collection of benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a joint encoding graph structure and textual node descriptors to learn vector representations for GO terms.",Dentro do Escopo,Falha na requisição para o DOI: 10.1093/bib/bbac318

Next, gene and GO features are projected to a common embedding space via a nonlinear projection. Then cross-view contrastive loss is applied to maximize the agreement of corresponding gene-GO associations and lead to meaningful gene representation. Finally, CoGO infers the similarity between diseases by the cosine similarity of disease representation vectors derived from related gene embedding. In our experiments, CoGO outperforms the most competitive baseline method on both AUROC and AUPRC, especially improves 19.57% in AUPRC (0.7733). The prediction results are significantly comparable with other disease similarity studies and thus highly credible.

Finite automata are taken as such a model. To systematize knowledge in the field of finite-state cryptography, it was decided to use ontology. This paper discusses the construction of an ontological model of finite-automaton cryptography. The proposed ontological model will have four main levels: the ontology of knowledge representation, the ontology of the top level, the domain ontology and practical ontologies. The methodology of conceptual maps was taken as the ontology of knowledge representation. The ontology of the top level contains basic information about cryptography and automata theory, the domain ontology describes directly the finite automaton cryptography. As an example of practical ontology, a public-key cryptosystem based on finite automata was considered. The presented ontology is modeled for the first time and gives a clear understanding of the use of finite automata in cryptography, systematizes the information obtained in the course of the research on this subject area, is a prerequisite in the further development of cryptosystems based on the theory of automata.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo

We propose an account of languages as aggregates of dispositions distributed across aggregates of persons, and in doing so we address linguistic competences and the processes that realize them. This paves the way for representing additional types of language-related entities. Like demographic data of other sorts, data about languages may be of use to researchers in a number of areas, including biomedical research. Data on the languages used in clinical encounters are typically included in medical records, and capture an important factor in patient-provider interactions. Like many types of patient and demographic data, data on a person’s preferred and primary languages are organized in different ways by different systems. This can be a barrier to data integration. We believe that a robust framework for representing language in general and preferred and primary language in particular – which has been lacking in ontologies thus far – can promote more successful integration of language-related data from disparate data sources.",Fora do Escopo,Fora do Escopo
