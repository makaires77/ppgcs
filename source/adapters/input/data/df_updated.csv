10.25205/1818-7900-2022-20-4-24-38,journal-article,2023-06-14,Domain Ontology Representation Model Based on Graph Databases,"The article presents an approach to modeling domain ontologies based on graph databases. Ontology is traditionally considered as a means of studying and formalizing the subject area. Based on ontologies, knowledge bases of information systems are formed, which can later be replenished and used to study certain applied aspects of the subject area. At the same time, with the development of NoSQL technologies and graph databases aimed at optimizing work with related data, it becomes possible to design a data warehouse without a strict pre-established domain model. Due to the obvious graph nature of ontologies, graph databases are a promising solution for storing and working with ontologies. However, with all the similarities, the ontology and data models used in graph DBMSs are not so easy to combine. The paper proposes an approach to the integration of ontological and graph models of knowledge representation and considers its application in creating a database for a prototype of a web ontology editor. Visual tools for editing ontologies are described, an algorithm for layer-by-layer rendering of a directed graph is given, a mechanism for generating dynamic forms for editing classes and ontology instances is described, and basic support for ontological design patterns is implemented.",

Crop diversification and rotation enables farmers to increase their income and crop yields while enhancing their farm sustainability against climatic events and pest attacks. Farmers must plan their agricultural work per year and over successive years. Planning decisions are made on the basis of their experience regarding previous plans. For the purpose of assisting farmers in planning decisions and monitoring, we developed the <jats:italic>Crop Planning and Production Process Ontology</jats:italic> (C3PO), i.e., a representation of agricultural knowledge and data for diversified crop production. C3PO is composed of eight modules to capture all crop production dimensions and complexity for representing farming practices and constraints. It encodes agricultural processes and farm plot organization and captures common agricultural knowledge. C3PO introduces a representation of technical itineraries, i.e., sequences of technical farming tasks to grow vegetables, from soil identification and seed selection to harvest and storage. C3PO is the backbone of a knowledge graph which aggregates data from heterogeneous related semantic resources, e.g., organism taxonomies, chemicals, reference crop listings, or development stages. C3PO and its knowledge graph are used by the Elzeard enterprise to develop knowledge-based decision support systems for farmers. This article describes how we built C3PO and its knowledge graph—which are both publicly available—and briefly outlines their applications.",

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            The Gene Ontology has become an extremely useful tool for the analysis of genomic data and structuring of biological knowledge. Several excellent software tools for navigating the gene ontology have been developed. However, no existing system provides an interactively expandable graph-based view of the gene ontology hierarchy. Furthermore, most existing tools are web-based or require an Internet connection, will not load local annotations files, and provide either analysis or visualization functionality, but not both.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            To address the above limitations, we have developed GOLEM (Gene Ontology Local Exploration Map), a visualization and analysis tool for focused exploration of the gene ontology graph. GOLEM allows the user to dynamically expand and focus the local graph structure of the gene ontology hierarchy in the neighborhood of any chosen term. It also supports rapid analysis of an input list of genes to find enriched gene ontology terms. The GOLEM application permits the user either to utilize local gene ontology and annotations files in the absence of an Internet connection, or to access the most recent ontology and annotation information from the gene ontology webpage. GOLEM supports global and organism-specific searches by gene ontology term name, gene ontology id and gene name.

The development of approaches that identify potentially spurious parts of a given knowledge base is therefore highly relevant. We propose an approach for ontology completion that transforms an ontology into a graph and recommends missing edges using structure-only link analysis methods. By systematically evaluating thirteen methods (some for knowledge graphs) on eight different semantic resources, including Gene Ontology, Food Ontology, Marine Ontology, and similar ontologies, we demonstrate that a structure-only link analysis can offer a scalable and computationally efficient ontology completion approach for a subset of analyzed data sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the most extensive systematic study of the applicability of different types of link analysis methods across semantic resources from different domains. It demonstrates that by considering symbolic node embeddings, explanations of the predictions (links) can be obtained, making this branch of methods potentially more valuable than black-box methods.",

A personalized learning process requires an adaptive learning system (ALS). In order to adapt, a learner model is required. Thus, modelling the learner model in an adaptive system environment is a key point to success in recommending the learner. The ontology-based approach was used to model the adaptive learning model in this research.   Ontology is a graph structure that consists of a collection of contexts, relationships, and models which related to contexts. The ontology of the learner model enables to produce a description of learner’s properties which contains important information about domain knowledge, learning performance, interests, preference, goal, tasks, and personal traits.Keywords - Personalized Learning, Adaptive Learning System, Ontology, Learner Model",

This dependency leads to some limitations in real applications. Here, we present a semantic similarity algorithm (SSA), that relies exclusively on the GO. When calculating the semantic similarity between a pair of input GO terms, SSA takes into account the shortest path between them, the depth of their nearest common ancestor, and a novel similarity score calculated between the definitions of the involved GO terms. In our work, we use SSA to calculate semantic similarities between pairs of proteins by combining pairwise semantic similarities between the GO terms that annotate the involved proteins. The reliability of SSA was evaluated by comparing the resulting semantic similarities between proteins with the functional similarities between proteins derived from expert annotations or sequence similarity. Comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods showed that SSA is highly competitive with the other methods. SSA provides a reliable measure for semantics similarity independent of external databases of functional-annotation observations. ",

Establishing a unifying data model is recognized as a cornerstone to such solutions. Here, the challenge lies both in agreeing on a common information context, and in selecting appropriate model representations, model query and update techniques, which guarantee model extensibility. While already existing ISOagriNET Data Dictionaries capture broad variety of the livestock and dairy farming concepts, the existing model representation technics cannot support efficient model extension. In this paper, we present our experience with using the representation and query standards and tools of the Semantic Web, endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), in particular the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and the SPARQL query standard, to encode and manipulate the dairy farming domain knowledge in a form of the Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO). Within the research project agriOpenLink the DFO has been created in two phases. The first phase focused on using the Semantic Web tools to facilitate easy encoding and manipulation of the dairy farming domain knowledge and the platform operational data models. The second phase focused on translating ISOagriNET Data Dictionaries into their semantic representations. Resulting DFO is maintained in a semantic repository, and it presents a knowledge graph and as integration backbone for the agriOpenLink decision support platform.",

Methods using the name often only use the similarity between the individual elements in the ontology to predict the semantic relations between two ontologies, while the latter measure the mapping between two ontologies by means of the structural relations between the elements. The effects of these two kinds of mapping strategies are not ideal. Addressing this issue, the work presented in this paper proposes an ontology mapping approach, in which the ontology element name and structure are combined. It uses the approaches based on linguistics and distance to generate a variable weight semantic graph. On this graph, the similarity of element names and structure are calculated through iterative computation. In the process of iteration, similarity result values are constantly adjusted. The approach avoids the problem of single methods that cannot use the entire amount of ontology information; therefore, it provides a more ideal mapping result. For making full use of the message of ontology, our implementation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mapping approach.",

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                Protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction is an important task towards the understanding of many bioinformatics functions and applications, such as predicting protein functions, gene-disease associations and disease-drug associations. However, many previous PPI prediction researches do not consider missing and spurious interactions inherent in PPI networks. To address these two issues, we define two corresponding tasks, namely missing PPI prediction and spurious PPI prediction, and propose a method that employs graph embeddings that learn vector representations from constructed Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) graphs and then use embedded vectors to achieve the two tasks. Our method leverages on information from both term–term relations among GO terms and term-protein annotations between GO terms and proteins, and preserves properties of both local and global structural information of the GO annotation graph.

               Motivation: The results of initial analyses for many high-throughput technologies commonly take the form of gene or protein sets, and one of the ensuing tasks is to evaluate the functional coherence of these sets. The study of gene set function most commonly makes use of controlled vocabulary in the form of ontology annotations. For a given gene set, the statistical significance of observing these annotations or ‘enrichment’ may be tested using a number of methods. Instead of testing for significance of individual terms, this study is concerned with the task of assessing the global functional coherence of gene sets, for which novel metrics and statistical methods have been devised.
               Results: The metrics of this study are based on the topological properties of graphs comprised of genes and their Gene Ontology annotations. A novel aspect of these methods is that both the enrichment of annotations and the relationships among annotations are considered when determining the significance of functional coherence. We applied our methods to perform analyses on an existing database and on microarray experimental results. Here, we demonstrated that our approach is highly discriminative in terms of differentiating coherent gene sets from random ones and that it provides biologically sensible evaluations in microarray analysis. We further used examples to show the utility of graph visualization as a tool for studying the functional coherence of gene sets.

However, existing security risk analysis methods for the IoV either focus only on certain levels, such as the component level, or perform only a static analysis. This paper proposes a dynamic attack graph generation method for the IoV to identify and visually display the security risks caused by the associated vulnerabilities in an IoV system. First, using the actual architecture of the IoV, this paper shows how to model the security elements and their relationships in the IoV system and proposes a network security ontology model for this system. Second, it shows how to construct a reasoning rule base according to the causal relationship between the vulnerabilities using the Semantic Web Rule Language Finally, in view of the rapid change in the network topology of the IoV, a dynamic attack graph generation algorithm based on an ontology reasoning engine is proposed, which can effectively reduce the overhead caused by the changes in the attack graph. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an actual security event scenario and a constructed scenario. The experimental results show that the algorithm can dynamically and accurately display the network attack graph of the IoV. The proposed method is helpful in globally analyzing the threat caused by the combined exploitation of the vulnerabilities in an IoV system and risk management.",

However, since the structural and temporal characteristics of medical records are affected by many uncertain factors, there are many limitations in medication recommendation methods based on EHRs. Specifically, most existing works either fail to adequately assess the structural correlation and temporal dependency among various medical entities or ignore existing knowledge of Drug–Drug Interactions (DDI), which could lead to adverse outcomes. These factors contribute to poor recommendation quality. Therefore, we propose a medical ontology tree model combined with the Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for medication recommendations. First, the class hierarchy extracted from the medical ontology and the GAT model is used to learn the ICD-9 codes of diagnoses and procedures, which enriches the semantic representation of medical entities. Secondly, Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) are used to learn the temporal characteristics of medical entities. Finally, memory bank, dynamic memory and DDI graph are used to optimize the hidden layer results, which improve the accuracy of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the previous methods in all evaluation indicators, and the recommended results have a lower DDI rate.",

With the increasing size of ontologies, ontology understanding, which is playing an important role in different tasks, is becoming more difficult. Consequently, ontology summarization, as a way to distill key information from an ontology and generate an abridged version to facilitate a better understanding, is getting growing attention. In this survey paper we review existing ontology summarization techniques and focus mainly on graph-based methods, which represent an ontology as a graph and apply centrality-based and other measures to identify the most important elements of an ontology as its summary. After analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, we highlight a few potential directions for future research. ",

                  Data on 3242 rare diseases were extracted from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science Genetic and Rare Diseases Information center internal data resources. The rare disease data enriched with additional biomedical data, including gene and phenotype ontologies, biological pathway data, and small molecule-target activity data, to create a knowledge graph (KG). Node embeddings were trained and clustered. We validated the disease clusters through semantic similarity and feature enrichment analysis.

               Aiming at the problems of complex structure and multi-source heterogeneity, imperfect knowledge representation, single knowledge extraction method, and difficulty of sharing and reuse in the knowledge field of turbine generator set fault diagnosis. The construction of knowledge graph is studied from multiple dimensions such as experts, fault characteristics, diagnosis techniques, research results, and solutions in the field for fault diagnosis knowledge of turbine generator set. And an ontology model of fault diagnosis knowledge for the turbine generator set is constructed. The entities, attributes, and relationships of the fault diagnosis knowledge graph for the turbine generator set are represented based on the model. The knowledge graph data are stored by the Neo4j graph database. The problems caused by multi-source and heterogeneous knowledge, fuzzy knowledge, and difficulty sharing, was solved in this field. The knowledge search system and automated quiz system based on knowledge graph are developed using the B/S framework. Many functions are realized by the knowledge graph, such as knowledge correlation, intelligent retrieval, visual display, and automated quiz, which improves the service and sharing ability of fault diagnosis knowledge for turbine generator set. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the system are verified by an example of a turbine generator set.",

To protect against social engineering attacks, a fundamental work is to know what constitutes social engineering.

The domain ontology defines 11 concepts of core entities that significantly constitute or affect social engineering domain, together with 22 kinds of relations describing how these entities related to each other. It provides a formal and explicit knowledge schema to understand, analyze, reuse and share domain knowledge of social engineering. Furthermore, this paper builds a knowledge graph based on 15 social engineering attack incidents and scenarios. 7 knowledge graph application examples (in 6 analysis patterns) demonstrate that the ontology together with knowledge graph is useful to 1) understand and analyze social engineering attack scenario and incident, 2) find the top ranked social engineering threat elements (e.g. the most exploited human vulnerabilities and most used attack mediums), 3) find potential social engineering threats to victims, 4) find potential targets for social engineering attackers, 5) find potential attack paths from specific attacker to specific target, and 6) analyze the same origin attacks.",

The article discusses the basic concepts characterizing this activity and illustrating their examples and mathematical models. These include the author's structuring of the functions and levels of research activity, a multifaceted system of criteria for evaluating the scientific and developmental results of research work performed by young researchers, a functional profile, a functional rating and a professional functional rating of a young researcher, calculated based on the assessment results of their research work. For the first time, a mathematical model for the formation of acceptable options for research activities is proposed, which allows forming the optimal developing methodological structure of planned research.

To address this difficulty of communication, ontologies and the communities they serve must agree on how their respective terminologies and formalizations relate to each other. The process of coming into accord and agreement is called “harmonization.” The Ontology Summit 2021 examined the overall landscape of ontologies, the many kinds of ontology generation and harmonization, as well as the sustainability of ontologies. The Communiqué synthesizes and summarizes the findings of the summit as well as earlier summits on related issues. One of the major impediments to harmonization is the relatively poor quality of natural language definitions in many ontologies.

               <jats:p />
               Drought disasters have caused serious impacts on the social economy and ecological environment, which are continuously and increasingly exacerbated by climate warming and other factors. Drought disaster management usually involves processing a mass of isolated data from many fields expressed in different terminologies and formats. These heterogeneous data or so-called data silos have greatly hindered drought disaster management in an information-rich manner. Establishing a drought disaster knowledge graph can facilitate the reuse of these heterogeneous data and provide references for drought disaster management, and ontology design and named entity recognition are the two major challenges. Therefore, in this study, we first designed a drought disaster ontology by recognizing the major concepts in the drought disaster field and their relationships, which was implemented with an ontology modeling language. We next constructed a drought disaster corpus and an integrated entity recognition model that was built by integrating multiple deep learning methods. Finally, we applied the integrated entity recognition model to extract information from the CNKI literature database. The integrated model shows satisfactory results in drought disaster named entity recognition. We thus conclude that combining ontology and deep learning technology toward establishing a knowledge graph for drought disasters is promising.",

               Background: The ability to produce timely, clinically actionable recommendations is a cornerstone of a robust precision oncology program. This requires the assimilation of rapidly changing precision oncology data that flows asynchronously from various EMR and lab sources. A key challenge is harmonization of omics biomarkers from hospital-based and commercial testing labs, rendering these omics data interpretable and comparable between patients, labs and reports. To address this challenge, we describe an automated system leveraging a hybrid ontology and graph structure to permit the rapid harmonization and interpretation of molecular diagnostic results across multiple labs.
               Methods: A two-part, fully automated system to ingest and harmonize omics biomarker data from hospital-based and commercial testing labs was developed. First, an ontology-based omics lexicon provides annotation of discrete laboratory values provided electronically. The ontology model is Manchester language-based with data stored in a relational document store. Second, a graph structure serves as the knowledge model and relates the annotated lab values to 12 types of clinically informative biomarkers, including sequence and copy number variants, tumor mutational burden, MSI, gene rearrangements, wild type, and expression biomarkers. The graph structure leverages the ontology to fully describe hierarchical and categorical data associated with each biomarker. Access to the omics knowledge model uses a RESTful API and relational database architecture. Acquisition of molecular data uses custom JSON schemas and a RESTful API.
               Results: Feeds from 7 commercial and hospital-based labs resulted in the receipt of &amp;gt;12,000 molecular diagnostic reports containing &amp;gt;2 million individual biomarker observations, with integration of each report achieved within 2 minutes of electronic data receipt. As of Nov. 2018, 81.2% of reports had at least one biomarker observation, while the remaining reports lacked results. Within these biomarker observations, 95.8% were represented in the ontology/graph structure, resulting in successful linkage to ~22,000 distinct harmonized biomarkers out of more than 12 million in the knowledge base. Of the linked, harmonized variant biomarkers, 4% are class-level (e.g. BRAF mutation) with the remainder reflecting more specificity (e.g. BRAF V600E). Within the set of more specific biomarkers, 54% represent a protein altering variant biomarker.
               Conclusions: We have built an automated, scalable system using a novel ontology/graph structure to reliably and automatically harmonize and integrate omics data into a real-world oncology precision medicine platform. Proof of concept validation has been demonstrated in over 12,000 patient reports, with the results being used to enable clinical trials matching and outcomes research.

In this article I play a counterpoint between two ‘ontological’ projects: one in geography, that foregrounds a reality conceived as an always-emergent assemblage of human and non-humans and troubles the politics that such assemblages imply. The other in ethnographic theory, that foregrounds that we are not only dealing with a shifting ontology, a (re)animated world, but also with multiple ontologies, a multiplicity of worlds animated in different ways. Thus, if the heterogeneity of always emerging assemblages troubles the political, the very heterogeneity of these heterogeneous assemblages troubles it even more. What kinds of politics and what kinds of knowledges does this troubling demand? I advance the notion of political ontology as a possible venue to explore this question. ",

               Measuring the semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental step in numerous functional bioinformatics applications. To fully exploit the metadata of GO terms, word embedding-based methods have been proposed recently to map GO terms to low-dimensional feature vectors. However, these representation methods commonly overlook the key information hidden in the whole GO structure and the relationship between GO terms. In this paper, we propose a novel representation model for GO terms, named GT2Vec, which jointly considers the GO graph structure obtained by graph contrastive learning and the semantic description of GO terms based on BERT encoders. Our method is evaluated on a protein similarity task on a collection of benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a joint encoding graph structure and textual node descriptors to learn vector representations for GO terms.",

However, designing an efficient framework to extract and incorporate information from different biological data using deep learning models remains unexplored.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title>We present CoGO, a Contrastive learning framework to predict disease similarity based on Gene network and Ontology structure, which incorporates the gene interaction network and gene ontology (GO) domain knowledge using graph deep learning models. First, graph deep learning models are applied to encode the features of genes and GO terms from separate graph structure data. Next, gene and GO features are projected to a common embedding space via a nonlinear projection. Then cross-view contrastive loss is applied to maximize the agreement of corresponding gene-GO associations and lead to meaningful gene representation. Finally, CoGO infers the similarity between diseases by the cosine similarity of disease representation vectors derived from related gene embedding. In our experiments, CoGO outperforms the most competitive baseline method on both AUROC and AUPRC, especially improves 19.57% in AUPRC (0.7733). The prediction results are significantly comparable with other disease similarity studies and thus highly credible. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed case study of top similar disease pairs which is demonstrated by other studies. Empirical results show that CoGO achieves powerful performance in disease similarity problem.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>https://github.com/yhchen1123/CoGO.</jats:sec>",

Finite automata are taken as such a model. To systematize knowledge in the field of finite-state cryptography, it was decided to use ontology. This paper discusses the construction of an ontological model of finite-automaton cryptography. The proposed ontological model will have four main levels: the ontology of knowledge representation, the ontology of the top level, the domain ontology and practical ontologies. The methodology of conceptual maps was taken as the ontology of knowledge representation. The ontology of the top level contains basic information about cryptography and automata theory, the domain ontology describes directly the finite automaton cryptography. As an example of practical ontology, a public-key cryptosystem based on finite automata was considered. The presented ontology is modeled for the first time and gives a clear understanding of the use of finite automata in cryptography, systematizes the information obtained in the course of the research on this subject area, is a prerequisite in the further development of cryptosystems based on the theory of automata.",
10.3233/ao-230049,journal-article,2023-11-03,"Ontology of language, with applications to demographic data","Here we present what we believe is a novel account of what languages are, along with an axiomatically rich representation of languages and language-related data that is based on this account. We propose an account of languages as aggregates of dispositions distributed across aggregates of persons, and in doing so we address linguistic competences and the processes that realize them. This paves the way for representing additional types of language-related entities. Like demographic data of other sorts, data about languages may be of use to researchers in a number of areas, including biomedical research. Data on the languages used in clinical encounters are typically included in medical records, and capture an important factor in patient-provider interactions. Like many types of patient and demographic data, data on a person’s preferred and primary languages are organized in different ways by different systems. This can be a barrier to data integration. We believe that a robust framework for representing language in general and preferred and primary language in particular – which has been lacking in ontologies thus far – can promote more successful integration of language-related data from disparate data sources.",
10.5121/ijwest.2021.12301,journal-article,2021-08-16,Ontology Service Center: A Datahub for Ontology Application,"With the growth of data-oriented research in humanities, a large number of research datasets have been created and published through web services. However, how to discover, integrate and reuse these distributed heterogeneous research datasets is a challenging task. Ontology is the soul between series digital humanities resources, which provides a good way for people to discover and understand these datasets. With the release of more and more linked open data and knowledge bases, a large number of ontologies have been produced at the same time. These ontologies have different publishing formats, consumption patterns, and interactions ways, which are not conductive to the user’s understanding of the datasets and the reuse of the ontologies. The Ontology Service Center platform consists of Ontology Query Center and Ontology Validation Center, mainly using linked data and ontology-based technologies. The Ontology Query Center realizes the functions of ontology publishing, querying, data interaction and online browsing, while the Ontology Validation Center can verify the status of using certain ontologies in the linked datasets. The empirical part of the paper uses the Confucius portrait as an example of how OSC can be used in the semantic annotation of images. In a word, the purpose of this paper is to construct the applied ecology of ontology to promote the development of knowledge graphs and the spread of ontology.",
10.3233/ao-210249,journal-article,2021-04-16,Ontology summit 2020 communiqué: Knowledge graphs,"An increasing amount of data is now available from public and private sources. Furthermore, the types, formats, and number of sources of data are also increasing. Techniques for extracting, storing, processing, and analyzing such data have been developed in the last few years for managing this bewildering variety based on a structure called a knowledge graph. Industry has devoted a great deal of effort to the development of knowledge graphs, and knowledge graphs are now critical to the functions of intelligent virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. The goal of the Ontology Summit 2020 was to understand not only what knowledge graphs are but also where they originated, why they are so popular, the current issues, and their future prospects. The summit sessions examined many examples of knowledge graphs and surveyed the relevant standards that exist and are in development for knowledge graphs. The purpose of this Communiqué is to summarize our understanding from the Summit in order to foster research and development of knowledge graphs.",
10.3233/ao-200228,journal-article,2020-05-15,BiGe-Onto: An ontology-based system for managing biodiversity and biogeography data1,"Great progress to digitize the world’s available Biodiversity and Biogeography data have been made recently, but managing data from many different providers and research domains still remains a challenge. A review of the current landscape of metadata standards and ontologies in Biodiversity sciences suggests that existing standards, such as the Darwin Core terminology, are inadequate for describing Biodiversity data in a semantically meaningful and computationally useful way. As a contribution to fill this gap, we present an ontology-based system, called BiGe-Onto, designed to manage data together from Biodiversity and Biogeography. As data sources, we use two internationally recognized repositories: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). BiGe-Onto system is composed of (i) BiGe-Onto Architecture (ii) a conceptual model called BiGe-Onto specified in OntoUML, (iii) an operational version of BiGe-Onto encoded in OWL 2, and (iv) an integrated dataset for its exploitation through a SPARQL endpoint. We will show use cases that allow researchers to answer questions that manage information from both domains.",

In previous works of the author published in the journal, key terms, scientific basis and borders of the ontology of design were considered. Here, an attempt is made in the historical aspect to examine the origins of the ontology of design from Vitruvius, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and other sages of antiquity to contemporaries who made a significant contribution to the development of this scientific direction - Vittich, Valkman, Samoylovich and many other eminent scientists. The key role of the ontological analysis of the subject area, search and substantiation of formalisms and formal methods in describing both the subject area itself and the processes modeled in it is emphasized. The paper presents, on the example of articles published in the journal over eight years, the geography of the topics touched upon, the authors, and the organizations representing them. The author took the liberty to mark the works, significant in his opinion, published in the journal, to identify areas in which the results have not yet been obtained and which could fill in the gaps in the mosaic of published works in the journal. In the subject area of social design, the author examines ontological dominants, argues with other authors about blissful theories from Plato and Adam Smith to Wittih and Fresco. Understanding the eclecticism of the presented analysis and conclusions, the author invites the readers of the journal to a constructive discussion, formulating for this purpose questions on unsolved problems.",
